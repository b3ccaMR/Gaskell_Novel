The story is set in a small town called Hollingford and follows a young girl named Molly Gibson. Molly is excited to attend a festival at the nearby Cumnor Towers, the home of Lord and Lady Cumnor. The festival is an annual event organized by Lady Cumnor and her daughters, who run a school for girls in the town. Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, arranges for her to attend the festival, and she is invited by Lord Cumnor himself. Molly will be accompanied by the Miss Brownings, two sisters who are friends of the family. The story also mentions the influence and power of the Cumnor family in the town, as well as the social dynamics and expectations of the time.

Molly Gibson attends a grand event at the Towers with the Miss Brownings. She feels out of place and uncomfortable, but is distracted by the beauty of the grounds. Molly becomes overwhelmed and faints, and is taken to rest by Mrs. Kirkpatrick. She wakes up to find that everyone has left and she is alone. Mrs. Kirkpatrick informs her that her father has come to pick her up, and Molly is relieved to leave the grand house. On the way home, Molly expresses her gratitude to her father and reflects on her experience at the Towers. Mr. Gibson later visits the family to thank them for their hospitality.

Sixteen years before the start of the story, the town of Hollingford was shocked to learn that their beloved doctor, Mr. Hall, was taking on a partner, Mr. Gibson. Mr. Gibson was a mysterious figure, with little known about his background. Despite initial resistance, Mr. Gibson quickly became popular and successful, even being invited to dine with the Earl. Mr. Gibson's wife died a few years after their marriage, leaving him with their daughter, Molly. Molly had a close relationship with her father, who was strict about her education. He hired a governess, Miss Eyre, who faced criticism from the family's maid, Betty. Molly defended Miss Eyre and had a generally happy childhood.

Molly grows up in a quiet and monotonous life, with the only notable event being left behind at the Towers. She becomes a visitor at the school but avoids the annual festival at the great house. Lord Hollingford, the eldest son of Molly's neighbors, becomes a widower and spends more time at the Towers. He is shy and reserved but highly esteemed for his wisdom and scientific knowledge. Mr. Gibson, Molly's father, is the town doctor and is well-liked by Lord and Lady Cumnor. He forms a friendship with Lord Hollingford and enjoys the intellectual stimulation of their conversations. Squire Hamley, another neighbor, is an old and respected family who live a simple and traditional life. Mrs. Hamley, who is often ill, wishes for Molly to visit her, but Mr. Gibson initially refuses. Mr. Gibson takes on two pupils, Mr. Wynne and Mr. Coxe, and forms a special bond with Mr. Coxe due to his impulsive and humorous nature.

Mr. Gibson unexpectedly comes home and intercepts a love letter from Mr. Coxe to his daughter Molly. He confronts Mr. Coxe and tells him to leave the house, but eventually allows him to stay as long as he promises not to pursue Molly. Mr. Gibson then sends Molly to stay with Mrs. Hamley for a week. Molly is curious about the reason for her sudden trip and asks her father, but he refuses to tell her. He gives her money to buy new clothes before she leaves.

He assures her that there is no specific person in mind and that it would be a good thing for her and her father if he were to remarry. Molly spends time with the Squire exploring the gardens and fields, and he expresses his pride in his son Osborne's intelligence. The Squire also reflects on the differences between his own appearance and that of his sons. He mentions the possibility of Osborne marrying into a higher social class, but ultimately decides that it would not be a good match. The Squire escorts Molly back to the house and she goes to see Mrs. Hamley.

In this chapter, Molly's stay at the Hamley's is extended due to Miss Eyre's nephew falling ill with scarlet fever. Mr. Gibson is initially reluctant to let her stay longer, but eventually agrees. However, the Squire is unhappy about Molly staying with his sons, fearing they may fall in love with her. Osborne receives an invitation to stay with a friend and will not be returning home with Roger. Molly is disappointed but keeps herself busy with various tasks around the house.

Mrs. Hamley is anxious and in low spirits as they await the return of their son Roger. Molly, their visitor, hopes that Roger's arrival will improve the mood in the household.

Lady Cumnor dismisses the idea and they change the subject.

Mrs. Kirkpatrick happily accepts Lady Cumnor's invitation to stay at the Towers. She is pleased to have the opportunity to stay in a luxurious house and hopes that being associated with Lady Cumnor will improve her reputation. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is described as pretty and graceful, with auburn hair and a youthful appearance. She enjoys the comforts of the Towers and the contrast to her own shabby home. Lady Cumnor's health begins to decline, but she is reluctant to seek medical help. Lord Cumnor suggests that Mrs. Kirkpatrick ask the doctor to visit, but she is too afraid of displeasing Lady Cumnor to do so. Eventually, Lady Cumnor decides to see the doctor and finds relief in his advice. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is pleased with how well she gets along with Lady Cumnor and is intrigued by Lord Cumnor's suggestion of a potential match between her and the doctor.

Molly eventually tries to put on a brave face and accepts an invitation to spend time with Mrs. Kirkpatrick at the Towers.
