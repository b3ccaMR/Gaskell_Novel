## Using LLM's to finish Elizabeth Gaskell's unfinished novel: Wives and Daughters
---

Many well known writers have died with novels unfinished.
We came up with the idea to use a large language model to finish an unfinished novel in the style of the deceased writer.

We propose to use the author Elizabeth Gaskell:
She was born in England in 1810 and wrote 7 full novels, 5 non-fiction works, and numerous novellas, short stories, and poems. Her final novel "Wives and Daughters" was published in serialized form. She was a few chapters away from the end when she died of a stroke in 1865. Fortunately, she had already planned the conclusion for the book. Her editor completed it after her death. Her works are up on Project Gutenberg.
