Molly is excited to attend a festival at the nearby Cumnor Towers, the home of Lord and Lady Cumnor. The festival is an annual event organized by Lady Cumnor and her daughters, who run a school for girls in the town. Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, arranges for her to attend the festival, and she will be accompanied by the Miss Brownings, two sisters who are friends of the family. The chapter also introduces the social hierarchy of the town, with Lord Cumnor being the dominant figure and the townspeople showing deference to him and his family.\n","Molly Gibson attends a grand event at the Towers with the Miss Brownings. She feels out of place and uncomfortable, but is distracted by the beauty of the grounds. Molly becomes overwhelmed and faints, and is taken to rest by Mrs. Kirkpatrick. She wakes up to find that everyone has left and she is alone. Mrs. Kirkpatrick helps Molly get back to her father, who had come to pick her up. Molly is relieved to be back home and reflects on her unhappy experience at the Towers.\n","Sixteen years before the start of the story, the town of Hollingford was shocked to learn that their beloved doctor, Mr. Hall, was taking on a partner, Mr. Gibson. Mr. Gibson was a mysterious figure, with little known about his background. Despite initial resistance, Mr. Gibson quickly became popular and successful, even being invited to dine with the Earl. Mr. Gibson's wife, Molly's mother, died a few years after their marriage, leaving Mr. Gibson to raise their daughter alone. Molly had a close relationship with her father, who was strict about her education and discouraged her from becoming too educated. Molly's father hired Miss Eyre as a governess for her, but Molly's nurse, Betty, was jealous and critical of Miss Eyre. Molly defended Miss Eyre and had a happy childhood despite these small grievances.\n","Molly grows up in a quiet and monotonous life, with the only notable event being left behind at the Towers.

reader is introduced to Molly Gibson, a young girl who is excited to attend a festival at the Towers. The Towers is the home of Lord and Lady Cumnor, who are respected and influential figures in the town of Hollingford. Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, arranges for her to attend the festival, and she will be accompanied by the Miss Brownings. The chapter also mentions the presence of a widow named Clare, who is staying at the Towers and is in need of assistance.\n","\n","The story is set in a small town called Hollingford and follows a young girl named Molly Gibson. Molly is excited to attend a festival at the nearby Cumnor Towers, the home of Lord and Lady Cumnor. The festival is an annual event organized by Lady Cumnor and her daughters, who run a school for girls in the town. Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, arranges for her to attend the festival, and she is invited by Lord Cumnor himself. Molly will be accompanied by the Miss Brownings, two sisters who are friends of the family. The story also mentions the influence and power of the Cumnor family in the town, as well as the social dynamics and expectations of the time.\n","\n","Molly Gibson attends a grand event at the Towers with the Miss Brownings. She feels out of place and uncomfortable, but is distracted by the beauty of the grounds. Molly becomes overwhelmed and faints, and is taken to rest by Mrs. Kirkpatrick. She wakes up to find that everyone has left and she is alone. Mrs. Kirkpatrick informs her that her father has come to pick her up, and Molly is relieved to leave the grand house. On the way home, Molly expresses her gratitude to her father and reflects on her experience at the Towers. Mr. Gibson later visits the family to thank them for their hospitality.\n","\n","Sixteen years before the start of the story, the town of Hollingford was shocked to learn that their beloved doctor, Mr. Hall, was taking on a partner, Mr. Gibson. Mr. Gibson was a mysterious figure, with little known about his background. Despite initial resistance, Mr. Gibson quickly became popular and successful, even being invited to dine with the Earl. Mr. Gibson's wife died a few years after their marriage, leaving him with their daughter, Molly. Molly had a close relationship with her father, who was strict about her education. He hired a governess, Miss Eyre, who faced criticism from the family's maid, Betty. Molly defended Miss Eyre and had a generally happy childhood.\n","\n","Molly grows up in a quiet and monotonous life, with the only notable event being left behind at the Towers. She becomes a visitor at the school but avoids the annual festival at the great house. Lord Hollingford, the eldest son of Molly's neighbors, becomes a widower and spends more time at the Towers. He is shy and reserved but highly esteemed for his wisdom and scientific knowledge. Mr. Gibson, Molly's father, is the town doctor and is well-liked by Lord and Lady Cumnor. He forms a friendship with Lord Hollingford and enjoys the intellectual stimulation of their conversations. Squire Hamley, another neighbor, is an old and respected family who live a simple and traditional life. Mrs. Hamley, who is often ill, wishes for Molly to visit her, but Mr. Gibson initially refuses. Mr. Gibson takes on two pupils, Mr. Wynne and Mr. Coxe, and forms a special bond with Mr. Coxe due to his impulsive and humorous nature.\n","\n","Mr. Gibson unexpectedly comes home and intercepts a love letter from Mr. Coxe to his daughter Molly. He confronts Mr. Coxe and tells him to leave the house, but eventually allows him to stay as long as he promises not to pursue Molly. Mr. Gibson then sends Molly to stay with Mrs. Hamley for a week. Molly is curious about the reason for her sudden trip and asks her father, but he refuses to tell her. He gives her money to buy new clothes before she leaves.\n","\n","Molly Gibson visits the Hamleys and is greeted warmly by Mrs. Hamley. Molly is curious about her father's potential second marriage and asks the Squire about it. He assures her that there is no specific person in mind and that it would be a good thing for her and her father if he were to remarry. Molly spends time with the Squire exploring the gardens and fields, and he expresses his pride in his son Osborne's intelligence. The Squire also reflects on the differences between his own appearance and that of his sons. He mentions the possibility of Osborne marrying into a higher social class, but ultimately decides that it would not be a good match. The Squire escorts Molly back to the house and she goes to see Mrs. Hamley.\n","\n","In this chapter, Molly's stay at the Hamley's is extended due to Miss Eyre's nephew falling ill with scarlet fever. Mr. Gibson is initially reluctant to let her stay longer, but eventually agrees. However, the Squire is unhappy about Molly staying with his sons, fearing they may fall in love with her. Osborne receives an invitation to stay with a friend and will not be returning home with Roger. Molly is disappointed but keeps herself busy with various tasks around the house.\n","\n","Mrs. Hamley is anxious and in low spirits as they await the return of their son Roger. Molly, their visitor, hopes that Roger's arrival will improve the mood in the household. Molly spends the afternoon in her room, copying poems written by Osborne Hamley, Roger's older brother. Suddenly, Roger arrives home and Molly hears Mrs. Hamley burst into tears. Molly comforts her and learns that Osborne did not do well in his exams. Mrs. Hamley is upset and Roger is trying to keep the conversation light. Molly is disappointed in Roger for bringing bad news so soon after his arrival. Molly and Roger avoid each other and Molly wishes she could go home. Meanwhile, Lady Cumnor plans for Mrs. Kirkpatrick, a friend of the family, to come stay at the Towers. Lord Cumnor suggests that Mrs. Kirkpatrick should marry Mr. Gibson, a widower who lives nearby. Lady Cumnor dismisses the idea and they change the subject.\n","\n","Mrs. Kirkpatrick happily accepts Lady Cumnor's invitation to stay at the Towers. She is pleased to have the opportunity to stay in a luxurious house and hopes that being associated with Lady Cumnor will improve her reputation. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is described as pretty and graceful, with auburn hair and a youthful appearance. She enjoys the comforts of the Towers and the contrast to her own shabby home. Lady Cumnor's health begins to decline, but she is reluctant to seek medical help. Lord Cumnor suggests that Mrs. Kirkpatrick ask the doctor to visit, but she is too afraid of displeasing Lady Cumnor to do so. Eventually, Lady Cumnor decides to see the doctor and finds relief in his advice. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is pleased with how well she gets along with Lady Cumnor and is intrigued by Lord Cumnor's suggestion of a potential match between her and the doctor.\n","\n","Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, proposes to Mrs. Kirkpatrick and she accepts. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is pleased with the proposal and hopes to become a mother figure to Molly. However, when Molly learns of her father's plans, she is devastated and feels betrayed. She confides in Roger Hamley, who offers her comfort and advice. Molly eventually tries to put on a brave face and accepts an invitation to spend time with Mrs. Kirkpatrick at the Towers.\n","\n","In this chapter, Mrs. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Gibson discuss the arrangements for their upcoming wedding. Mrs. Kirkpatrick is hesitant to have her daughter, Cynthia, be a bridesmaid as she believes it would be uncomfortable for her to be next to the faded bride, her mother. Mrs. Kirkpatrick had hoped to leave her job as a schoolteacher and marry Mr. Gibson quickly, but Lady Cumnor suggests that she continue teaching until Christmas to avoid inconveniencing her students. Mr. Gibson agrees with this plan, much to Mrs. Kirkpatrick's disappointment. Molly, Mr. Gibson's daughter, is also upset by the idea of her father's upcoming marriage and the potential changes it will bring. She confides in Roger Hamley, who offers her comfort and advice.\n","\n","Lord Cumnor is pleased with the news of Mr. Gibson and Clare's engagement and takes credit for bringing them together. Lady Cumnor is skeptical of his involvement. Clare wants to get married before Christmas, despite Lady Cumnor's suggestion to wait. Mr. Gibson wants Cynthia to come for the wedding, but Mrs. Kirkpatrick convinces him it's too expensive. Mrs. Kirkpatrick uses the money given to her for her trousseau to pay off debts instead. Mr. Gibson asks the Miss Brownings to help prepare his house for his future wife. He also asks if Molly can stay with them until after the wedding.\n","\n","Molly Gibson's father is worried about her growing friendship with Roger Hamley, fearing that the heir to the estate might take a liking to her. Molly and Roger have a close relationship, but both imagine different future partners for themselves. Molly's stepmother, Mrs. Hamley, misses Molly's companionship after she leaves the house. Molly stays with the Miss Brownings, who question her about her relationship with Roger, leading to a misunderstanding. Molly feels out of place in her father's newly renovated house and is unsure about her role in her father's upcoming wedding. Molly and her father stay at the Manor-house, where Molly meets Mr. Preston, who flirts with her. Molly and Mr. Preston discuss Miss Kirkpatrick, who is set to live with Molly and her father after leaving school. Molly is unsure about Miss Kirkpatrick's personality and does not write to her. Molly and her father spend the night at the Manor-house and Molly overhears Mr. Preston's conversation about his preference for a fire in his bedroom.\n","\n","Molly attends a wedding where she is patronized by Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet. Lady Harriet tries to console Molly about her father's second marriage and mentions that Molly will have a companion in Cynthia Kirkpatrick. Molly is then left alone with Lady Harriet, who tries to tame her and offers to lend her books. Molly is later visited by Roger Hamley, who invites her to spend the day with his family. Molly enjoys her time with Mrs. Hamley and meets Osborne, who she initially finds disappointing but later becomes intrigued by. Molly returns home to Miss Brownings, who inform her that Lady Harriet had visited and had tea with them.\n","\n","Molly returns home to find her house transformed and her new stepmother, Mrs. Gibson, already causing tension with the servants. Molly struggles with the idea of calling Mrs. Gibson \"mamma\" as it was a name she associated with her deceased mother. Mrs. Gibson is tired and decides to have her meal in her room, leaving Molly feeling lonely and unappreciated. Molly's father, Mr. Gibson, is called away to tend to a dying patient, leaving Molly to take care of everything. The servants complain about Mrs. Gibson, leading to Molly's old nurse, Betty, giving her notice. Molly tries to convince Mrs. Gibson to let Betty stay, but she refuses. Mrs. Gibson is more concerned with the social status of her visitors and decides to have late dinners to accommodate them. The cook also leaves, causing Mr. Gibson to have to eat poorly made French dishes. Despite the small disagreements, Mr. Gibson tries to remain positive and hopeful for a better future with his new wife.\n","\n","In this chapter, the young Mr. Hamleys visit Mrs. Gibson as a bride. Mrs. Gibson tries to impress them with her appearance and conversation, while Molly observes their interactions. Osborne Hamley appears different from before, and Roger seems concerned about his brother's health. The Squire later visits and informs Molly that Osborne has failed his exams and his mother is ill. He asks Molly to come to the Hall to keep his wife company, but Mrs. Gibson insists that Molly has prior engagements. The Squire is disappointed but agrees to come back for Molly the next day. Molly is upset by the situation and goes to her room to cry. She thinks about Mrs. Hamley and the Hall, feeling guilty for not going with the Squire.\n","\n","Molly realizes that there is trouble at Hamley Hall due to the large amount of debt Osborne has accumulated at Cambridge. Mrs. Hamley is very ill and Molly tries to comfort her. The Squire is angry with Osborne and forbids him from coming home until he pays off his debts. Mr. Gibson is called to the Hall to help Mrs. Hamley, and he sends for Osborne and Roger to come home. Molly returns to Hollingford and Mrs. Gibson tries to convince her to go to a dance, but Molly refuses. Mr. Gibson decides that Molly should stay home and he will fetch her later.\n","\n","Molly returns to the Hall and finds Osborne there. Mrs. Hamley asks about Osborne and Molly relays the information to her. Molly later speaks with Roger about Osborne's whereabouts and his debts. Mrs. Hamley's condition worsens and Molly is unsure if she should stay longer. Osborne arrives and Molly accidentally overhears a conversation between him and Roger about a letter from his wife. Molly promises to keep the secret and leaves the room. Osborne and Roger are upset about the situation. Molly wonders who Osborne's wife is but is unable to find out. Molly leaves the Hall and feels a sense of discomfort and uncertainty about the situation. She is grateful for her straightforward life in Hollingford.\n","\n","Molly's father is not home when she returns and she learns that Cynthia, Mrs. Gibson's daughter, is coming home from France. Molly is excited to have a companion her own age. Cynthia arrives and Molly is immediately captivated by her beauty and charm. They bond over their shared love for Mrs. Hamley, who has recently passed away. Cynthia admits that she struggles to love people and wishes she could be good. Molly sympathizes with her and they discuss the strained relationship between Cynthia and her mother. Cynthia reveals that she resents her mother for neglecting her as a child and not allowing her to attend her wedding. Molly tries to encourage forgiveness, but Cynthia insists that she will never be better.\n","\n","Mrs. Gibson and Molly are surprised when Mr. Preston visits their home. Mrs. Gibson is cool towards him and there is tension in the air. They discuss Mr. Gibson's absence and Mrs. Gibson's loneliness. Cynthia returns home and Mr. Preston is immediately drawn to her. They have a conversation about public balls and the Hamley family. Molly is left feeling left out and Mrs. Gibson suggests a potential romantic connection between Cynthia and Mr. Osborne Hamley. Molly defends Mr. Roger Hamley and Cynthia makes a comment about weakness. Mrs. Gibson predicts that the two families will become close and that the Hollingford people are behindhand and commonplace.\n","\n","Mrs. Gibson's predictions about Osborne Hamley and her daughter Cynthia seem to be coming true, as Osborne frequently visits their home. Molly is puzzled by Osborne's behavior and his occasional absences, as she believes a married man should have a house and live with his wife. Osborne also appears unhappy at home and often mentions his mother and the \"happy days that are gone.\" Molly is unsure how much her father knows about the Hamley family and does not want to question him too closely. Osborne's brother Roger also visits the Gibson household and shows a particular interest in Cynthia. Molly feels uneasy about their interactions. The next day, Roger comes to visit Molly and they discuss the Hamley family and the possibility of Molly staying at the Hall. Roger also expresses his admiration for Cynthia.
