In a country there was a shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there was a house, and in that house there was a room, and in that room there was a bed, and in that bed there lay a little girl; wide awake and longing to get up, but not daring to do so for fear of the unseen power in the next room--a certain Betty, whose slumbers must not be disturbed until six o\\'clock struck, when she wakened of herself \"as sure as clockwork,\" and left the household very little peace afterwards. It was a June morning, and early as it was, the room was full of sunny warmth and light.On the drawers opposite to the little white dimity bed in which Molly Gibson lay, was a primitive kind of bonnet-stand on which was hung a bonnet, carefully covered over from any chance of dust with a large cotton handkerchief, of so heavy and serviceable a texture that if the thing underneath it had been a flimsy fabric of gauze and lace and flowers, it would have been altogether \"scomfished\" (again to quote from Betty\\'s vocabulary). But the bonnet was made of solid straw, and its only trimming was a plain white ribbon put over the crown, and forming the strings. Still, there was a neat little quilling inside, every plait of which Molly knew, for had she not made it herself the evening before, with infinite pains? and was there not a little blue bow in this quilling, the very first bit of such finery Molly had ever had the prospect of wearing?', 'Molly Gibson saw all this, but all she thought about it was, \"Oh! it will be a fine day! I was afraid it never, never would come; or that, if it ever came, it would be a rainy day!\" Five-and-forty years ago, children\\'s pleasures in a country town were very simple, and Molly had lived for twelve long years without the occurrence of any event so great as that which was now impending. Poor child! it is true that she had lost her mother, which was a jar to the whole tenour of her life; but that was hardly an event in the sense referred to; and besides, she had been too young to be conscious of it at the time. The pleasure she was looking forward to to-day was her first share in a kind of annual festival in Hollingford.The little straggling town faded away into country on one side close to the entrance-lodge of a great park, where lived my Lord and Lady Cumnor: \"the earl\" and \"the countess,\" as they were always called by the inhabitants of the town; where a very pretty amount of feudal feeling still lingered, and showed itself in a number of simple ways, droll enough to look back upon, but serious matters of importance at the time. It was before the passing of the Reform Bill, but a good deal of liberal talk took place occasionally between two or three of the more enlightened freeholders living in Hollingford; and there was a great Tory family in the county who, from time to time, came forward and contested the election with the rival Whig family of Cumnor. One would have thought that the above-mentioned liberal-talking inhabitants would have, at least, admitted the possibility of their voting for the Hely-Harrison, and thus trying to vindicate their independence. But no such thing. \"The earl\" was lord of the manor, and owner of much of the land on which Hollingford was built; he and his household were fed, and doctored, and, to a certain measure, clothed by the good people of the town; their fathers\\' grandfathers had always voted for the eldest son of Cumnor Towers, and following in the ancestral track, every man-jack in the place gave his vote to the liege lord, totally irrespective of such chimeras as political opinion.', 'Now, as the countess was absent from the Towers for a considerable part of the year, she was glad to enlist the sympathy of the Hollingford ladies in this school, with a view to obtaining their aid as visitors during the many months that she and her daughters were away. And the various unoccupied gentlewomen of the town responded to the call of their liege lady, and gave her their service as required; and along with it, a great deal of whispered and fussy admiration. \"How good of the countess! So like the dear countess--always thinking of others!\" and so on; while it was always supposed that no strangers had seen Hollingford properly, unless they had been taken to the countess\\'s school, and been duly impressed by the neat little pupils, and the still neater needlework there to be inspected. In return, there was a day of honour set apart every summer, when with much gracious and stately hospitality, Lady Cumnor and her daughters received all the school visitors at the Towers, the great family mansion standing in aristocratic seclusion in the centre of the large park, of which one of the lodges was close to the little town. The order of this annual festivity was this. About ten o\\'clock one of the Towers\\' carriages rolled through the lodge, and drove to different houses, wherein dwelt a woman to be honoured; picking them up by ones or twos, till the loaded carriage drove back again through the ready portals, bowled along the smooth tree-shaded road, and deposited its covey of smartly-dressed ladies on the great flight of steps leading to the ponderous doors of Cumnor Towers. Back again to the town; another picking up of womankind in their best clothes, and another return, and so on till the whole party were assembled either in the house or in the really beautiful gardens. After the proper amount of exhibition on the one part, and admiration on the other, had been done, there was a collation for the visitors, and some more display and admiration of the treasures inside the house. Towards four o\\'clock, coffee was brought round; and this was a signal of the approaching carriage that was to take them back to their own homes; whither they returned with the happy consciousness of a well-spent day, but with some fatigue at the long-continued exertion of behaving their best, and talking on stilts for so many hours. Nor were Lady Cumnor and her daughters free from something of the same self-approbation, and something, too, of the same fatigue; the fatigue that always follows on conscious efforts to behave as will best please the society you are in.', 'For the first time in her life, Molly Gibson was to be included among the guests at the Towers. She was much too young to be a visitor at the school, so it was not on that account that she was to go; but it had so happened that one day when Lord Cumnor was on a \"pottering\" expedition, he had met Mr. Gibson, _the_ doctor of the neighbourhood, coming out of the farm-house my lord was entering; and having some small question to ask the surgeon (Lord Cumnor seldom passed any one of his acquaintance without asking a question of some sort--not always attending to the answer; it was his mode of conversation), he accompanied Mr. Gibson to the out-building, to a ring in the wall of which the surgeon\\'s horse was fastened. Molly was there too, sitting square and quiet on her rough little pony, waiting for her father. Her grave eyes opened large and wide at the close neighbourhood and evident advance of \"the earl;\" for to her little imagination the grey-haired, red-faced, somewhat clumsy man, was a cross between an arch-angel and a king.', '\"Your daughter, eh, Gibson?--nice little girl, how old? Pony wants grooming though,\" patting it as he talked. \"What\\'s your name, my dear? He\\'s sadly behindhand with his rent, as I was saying, but if he\\'s really ill, I must see after Sheepshanks, who is a hardish man of business. What\\'s his complaint? You\\'ll come to our school-scrimmage on Thursday, little girl--what\\'s-your-name? Mind you send her, or bring her, Gibson; and just give a word to your groom, for I\\'m sure that pony wasn\\'t singed last year, now, was he? Don\\'t forget Thursday, little girl--what\\'s-your-name?--it\\'s a promise between us, is it not?\" And off the earl trotted, attracted by the sight of the farmer\\'s eldest son on the other side of the yard.Mr. Gibson mounted, and he and Molly rode off. They did not speak for some time. Then she said, \"May I go, papa?\" in rather an anxious little tone of voice.\"Where, my dear?\" said he, wakening up out of his own professional thoughts.\"To the Towers--on Thursday, you know. That gentleman\" (she was shy of calling him by his title), \"asked me.\"', '\"Oh, papa!\" said Molly, reproachfully.\"You\\'d like to go then, would you?\"\"Yes; if I may!--He asked me, you know. Don\\'t you think I may?--he asked me twice over.\"\"Well! we\\'ll see--yes! I think we can manage it, if you wish it so much, Molly.\"Then they were silent again. By-and-by, Molly said,--\"Please, papa--I do wish to go,--but I don\\'t care about it.\"\"That\\'s rather a puzzling speech. But I suppose you mean you don\\'t care to go, if it will be any trouble to get you there. I can easily manage it, however, so you may consider it settled. You\\'ll want a white frock, remember; you\\'d better tell Betty you\\'re going, and she\\'ll see after making you tidy.\"Now, there were two or three things to be done by Mr. Gibson, before he could feel quite comfortable about Molly\\'s going to the festival at the Towers, and each of them involved a little trouble on his part. But he was very willing to gratify his little girl; so the next day he rode over to the Towers, ostensibly to visit some sick housemaid, but, in reality, to throw himself in my lady\\'s way, and get her to ratify Lord Cumnor\\'s invitation to Molly. He chose his time, with a little natural diplomacy; which, indeed, he had often to exercise in his intercourse with the great family. He rode into the stable-yard about twelve o\\'clock, a little before luncheon-time, and yet after the worry of opening the post-bag and discussing its contents was over. After he had put up his horse, he went in by the back-way to the house; the \"House\" on this side, the \"Towers\" at the front. He saw his patient, gave his directions to the housekeeper, and then went out, with a rare wild-flower in his hand, to find one of the ladies Tranmere in the garden, where, according to his hope and calculation, he came upon Lady Cumnor too,--now talking to her daughter about the contents of an open letter which she held in her hand, now directing a gardener about certain bedding-out plants.', '\"Thank you, so much, Mr. Gibson. Mamma, look! this is the _Drosera rotundifolia_ I have been wanting so long.\"\"Ah! yes; very pretty I daresay, only I am no botanist. Nanny is better, I hope? We can\\'t have any one laid up next week, for the house will be quite full of people,--and here are the Danbys waiting to offer themselves as well. One comes down for a fortnight of quiet, at Whitsuntide, and leaves half one\\'s establishment in town, and as soon as people know of our being here, we get letters without end, longing for a breath of country air, or saying how lovely the Towers must look in spring; and I must own, Lord Cumnor is a great deal to blame for it all, for as soon as ever we are down here, he rides about to all the neighbours, and invites them to come over and spend a few days.\"\"We shall go back to town on Friday the 18th,\" said Lady Agnes, in a consolatory tone.\"Ah, yes! as soon as we have got over the school visitors\\' affair. But it is a week to that happy day.\"\"By the way!\" said Mr. Gibson, availing himself of the good opening thus presented, \"I met my lord at the Cross-trees Farm yesterday, and he was kind enough to ask my little daughter, who was with me, to be one of the party here on Thursday; it would give the lassie great pleasure, I believe.\" He paused for Lady Cumnor to speak.', '\"She visits at the school, mamma,\" said Lady Agnes.\"Well, perhaps she does; I never said she did not. I knew there was one visitor of the name of Browning; I never knew there were two, but, of course, as soon as Lord Cumnor heard there was another, he must needs ask her; so the carriage will have to go backwards and forwards four times now to fetch them all. So your daughter can come quite easily, Mr. Gibson, and I shall be very glad to see her for your sake. She can sit bodkin with the Brownings, I suppose? You\\'ll arrange it all with them; and mind you get Nanny well up to her work next week.\"Just as Mr. Gibson was going away, Lady Cumnor called after him, \"Oh! by-the-by, Clare is here; you remember Clare, don\\'t you? She was a patient of yours, long ago.\"\"Clare,\" he repeated, in a bewildered tone.\"Don\\'t you recollect her? Miss Clare, our old governess,\" said Lady Agnes. \"About twelve or fourteen years ago, before Lady Cuxhaven was married.\"\"Oh, yes!\" said he. \"Miss Clare, who had the scarlet fever here; a very pretty delicate girl. But I thought she was married!\"', '\"Thank you, my lady. I\\'m afraid I cannot stop to-day. I have a long round to go; I\\'ve stayed here too long as it is, I\\'m afraid.\"Long as his ride had been that day, he called on the Miss Brownings in the evening, to arrange about Molly\\'s accompanying them to the Towers. They were tall handsome women, past their first youth, and inclined to be extremely complaisant to the widowed doctor.\"Eh dear! Mr. Gibson, but we shall be delighted to have her with us. You should never have thought of asking us such a thing,\" said Miss Browning the elder.\"I\\'m sure I\\'m hardly sleeping at nights for thinking of it,\" said Miss Phoebe. \"You know I\\'ve never been there before. Sister has many a time; but somehow, though my name has been down on the visitors\\' list these three years, the countess has never named me in her note; and you know I could not push myself into notice, and go to such a grand place without being asked; how could I?\"\"I told Phoebe last year,\" said her sister, \"that I was sure it was only inadvertence, as one may call it, on the part of the countess, and that her ladyship would be as hurt as any one when she didn\\'t see Phoebe among the school visitors; but Phoebe has got a delicate mind, you see, Mr. Gibson, and all I could say she wouldn\\'t go, but stopped here at home; and it spoilt all my pleasure all that day, I do assure you, to think of Phoebe\\'s face, as I saw it over the window-blinds, as I rode away; her eyes were full of tears, if you\\'ll believe me.\"', '\"Certainly,\" said he. \"And you see you are going this year; and last year it rained.\"\"Yes! I remember! I set myself to tidy my drawers, to string myself up, as it were; and I was so taken up with what I was about that I was quite startled when I heard the rain beating against the window-panes. \\'Goodness me!\\' said I to myself, \\'whatever will become of sister\\'s white satin shoes, if she has to walk about on soppy grass after such rain as this?\\' for, you see, I thought a deal about her having a pair of smart shoes; and this year she has gone and got me a white satin pair just as smart as hers, for a surprise.\"\"Molly will know she\\'s to put on her best clothes,\" said Miss Browning. \"We could perhaps lend her a few beads, or artificials, if she wants them.\"\"Molly must go in a clean white frock,\" said Mr. Gibson, rather hastily; for he did not admire the Miss Brownings\\' taste in dress, and was unwilling to have his child decked up according to their fancy; he esteemed his old servant Betty\\'s as the more correct, because the more simple. Miss Browning had just a shade of annoyance in her tone as she drew herself up, and said, \"Oh! very well. It\\'s quite right, I\\'m sure.\" But Miss Phoebe said, \"Molly will look very nice in whatever she puts on, that\\'s certain.\"']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text_list = df['Text'].tolist()\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aQTuLDETYj4y"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","instruction_prompt = \"Summarize the plot of this paragraph. \"\n","params = {\"temperature\": 0.1, \"max_tokens\": 100}  # a temperature of 0.0 is deterministic\n","ai = AIChat(id=\"function\", params=params, console = False, save_messages=False, api_key=api_key)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"iLZ0r9Vjptd9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["summaries =[]"],"metadata":{"id":"WAxR3g-3llRD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","for i in range(530,len(text_list)):\n","  summary = \"\"\n","  try:\n","    summary = ai(text_list[i], id=\"function\", system=instruction_prompt)\n","    print(i)\n","    print(text_list[i])\n","    print(\"------\")\n","    print(summary)\n","    print(\"------\")\n","    print()\n","    print()\n","  except:\n","    summary = \"Error  on line \" + str(i)\n","    break\n","  summaries.append(summary)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"w1Re77YuYZhA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693169032307,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":486352,"user":{"displayName":"Eliza Thornton","userId":"13738708515567558230"}},"outputId":"92b93012-c23b-4500-ef86-736fef657bd6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["530\n","\"I should not be surprised if he invited Cynthia to pay him another visit in London,\" said Miss Browning. \"If he did it when he was poor, he's twenty times more likely to do it now he's a Queen's counsel.\"\"Ay, work it by the rule o' three, and she stands a good chance.

I always admire Cynthia's grace of manner, never too shy to speak, yet never putting herself forwards; she's quite a help to a party; and if she has a few airs and graces, why they're natural at her age! Now as for dear Molly, there's a kind of awkwardness about her--she broke one of our best china cups last time she was at a party at our house, and spilt the coffee on the new carpet; and then she got so confused that she hardly did anything but sit in a corner and hold her tongue all the rest of the evening.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph discusses the possibility of Cynthia being invited to visit London by someone referred to as \"he.\" Miss Browning believes that \"he\" is likely to invite Cynthia because he did so when he was poor and is now a Queen's counsel. Miss Phoebe mentions that Cynthia has already been to France and is well-traveled. Mrs. Goodenough expresses concern about Cynthia being in close proximity to someone from the country where Robespierre and Bonaparte were born. Miss Browning defends\n","------\n","\n","\n","531\n","\"Well, and did I say she wasn't? but was there any need for her to be stupid all the evening after?\"\"But you were rather sharp,--rather displeased--\"\"And I think it my duty to be sharp, ay, and cross too, when I see young folks careless. And when I see my duty clear, I do it; I'm not one to shrink from it, and they ought to be grateful to me. It's not every one that will take the trouble of reproving them, as Mrs. Goodenough knows. I'm very fond of Molly Gibson, very, for her own sake and for her mother's too; I'm not sure if I don't think she's worth half-a-dozen Cynthias, but for all that she shouldn't break my best china teacup, and then sit doing nothing for her livelihood all the rest of the evening.\"By this time Mrs. Goodenough gave evident signs of being tired; Molly's misdemeanors and Miss Browning's broken teacup were not as exciting subjects of conversation as Mrs. Gibson's newly-discovered good luck in having a successful London lawyer for a relation.Mr. Kirkpatrick had been, like many other men, struggling on in his profession, and encumbered with a large family of his own; he was ready to do a good turn for his connections, if it occasioned him no loss of time, and if (which was, perhaps, a primary condition) he remembered their existence. Cynthia's visit to Doughty Street nine or ten years ago had not made much impression upon him after he had once suggested its feasibility to his good-natured wife. He was even rather startled every now and then by the appearance of a pretty little girl amongst his own children, as they trooped in to dessert, and had to remind himself who she was. But as it was his custom to leave the table almost immediately and to retreat into a small back-room called his study, to immerse himself in papers for the rest of the evening, the child had not made much impression upon him; and probably the next time he remembered her existence was when Mrs. Kirkpatrick wrote to him to beg him to receive Cynthia for a night on her way to school at Boulogne. The same request was repeated on her return; but it so happened that he had not seen her either time; and only dimly remembered some remarks which his wife had made on one of these occasions, that it seemed to her rather hazardous to send so young a girl so long a journey without making more provision for her safety than Mrs. Kirkpatrick had done. He knew that his wife would fill up all deficiencies in this respect as if Cynthia had been her own daughter; and thought no more about her until he received an invitation to attend Mrs. Kirkpatrick's wedding with Mr. Gibson, the highly-esteemed surgeon of Hollingford, &c. &c.--an attention which irritated instead of pleasing him. \"Does the woman think I have nothing to do but run about the country in search of brides and bridegrooms, when this great case of Houghton _v._ Houghton is coming on, and I haven't a moment to spare?\" he asked of his wife.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Miss Browning is upset with Molly Gibson for being careless and breaking her teacup. She believes it is her duty to reprimand young people when they are careless and expects them to be grateful for her guidance. The conversation then shifts to Mrs. Gibson's good luck in having a successful lawyer relative. Mr. Kirkpatrick, the lawyer, has not been very involved in his family's affairs and only vaguely remembers Cynthia, Mrs. Gibson's daughter. He is irritated when\n","------\n","\n","\n","532\n","\"Nonsense! the case has been in the papers for days.\"\"But she mayn't know you are engaged in it.\"\"She mayn't,\" said he, meditatively--such ignorance was possible.But now the great case of Houghton _v._ Houghton was a thing of the past; the hard struggle was over, the comparative table-land of Q. C.-dom gained, and Mr. Kirkpatrick had leisure for family feeling and recollection. One day in the Easter vacation he found himself near Hollingford; he had a Sunday to spare, and he wrote to offer himself as a visitor to the Gibsons from Friday till Monday, expressing strongly (what he really felt, in a less degree,) his wish to make Mr. Gibson's acquaintance. Mr. Gibson, though often overwhelmed with professional business, was always hospitable; and moreover, it was always a pleasure to him to get out of the somewhat confined mental atmosphere which he had breathed over and over again, and have a whiff of fresh air: a glimpse of what was passing in the great world beyond his daily limits of thought and action. So he was ready to give a cordial welcome to his unknown relation. Mrs. Gibson was in a flutter of sentimental delight, which she fancied was family affection, but which might not have been quite so effervescent if Mr. Kirkpatrick had remained in his former position of struggling lawyer, with seven children, living in Doughty Street.\n","------\n","Mr. Kirkpatrick, a successful lawyer, has recently won a big case and now has some free time. He decides to visit his relatives, the Gibsons, in Hollingford. Mr. Gibson, a busy professional, is happy to have a visitor and Mrs. Gibson is excited to meet her unknown relative.\n","------\n","\n","\n","533\n","On its receipt, this letter was greeted in various ways by the four people who sate round the breakfast-table. Mrs. Gibson read it to herself first. Then, without telling what its contents were, so that her auditors were quite in the dark as to what her remarks applied, she said,--\"I think they might have remembered that I am a generation nearer to them than she is, but nobody thinks of family affection now-a days; and I liked him so much, and bought a new cookery-book, all to make it pleasant and agreeable and what he was used to.\" She said all this in a plaintive, aggrieved tone of voice; but as no one knew to what she was referring, it was difficult to offer her consolation. Her husband was the first to speak.\"If you want us to sympathize with you, tell us what is the nature of your woe.\"\"Why, I daresay it's what he means as a very kind attention, only I think I ought to have been asked before Cynthia,\" said she, reading the letter over again.\"Who's _he_? and what's meant for a 'kind attention'?\"\n","------\n","The paragraph introduces a letter that has been received by four people sitting around a breakfast table. Mrs. Gibson reads the letter to herself and expresses her disappointment that the sender did not consider her closer relationship to them. She also mentions buying a new cookery-book to make things pleasant for the sender. However, since the others at the table are unaware of the contents of the letter, they are confused and unable to offer her consolation. Mrs. Gibson's husband asks her to explain the nature of her distress\n","------\n","\n","\n","534\n","\"As I couldn't possibly have gone, it makes very little difference to me.\"\"But I could have gone; and, at any rate, he should have paid us the compliment: it's only a proper mark of respect, you know. So ungrateful, too, when I gave up my dressing-room on purpose for him!\"\"And I dressed for dinner every day he was here, if we are each to recapitulate all our sacrifices on his behalf. But, for all that, I didn't expect to be invited to his house. I shall be only too glad if he will come again to mine.\"\"I've a great mind not to let Cynthia go,\" said Mrs. Gibson reflectively.\"I can't go, mamma,\" said Cynthia, colouring. \"My gowns are all so shabby, and my old bonnet must do for the summer.\"\"Well, but you can buy a new one; and I'm sure it is high time you should get yourself another silk gown. You must have been saving up a great deal, for I don't know when you've had any new clothes.\"Cynthia began to say something, but stopped short. She went on buttering her toast, but she held it in her hand without eating it; without looking up either, as, after a minute or two of silence, she spoke again:--\n","------\n","The characters in this paragraph are discussing an event or invitation that one of them did not receive. One character is upset that they were not invited and feels that it is disrespectful. Another character suggests that they should invite the person to their own house instead. The conversation then shifts to the character's daughter, Cynthia, who is hesitant to attend the event because she does not have nice clothes. Her mother suggests that she buy new clothes and implies that Cynthia has been saving money. Cynthia starts to respond but stops\n","------\n","\n","\n","535\n","\"Nonsense, child! When a man in Mr. Kirkpatrick's position comes forward to offer a favour, it does not do to decline it without giving a sufficient reason. So kind of him as it is, too!\"\"Suppose you offer to go instead of me?\" proposed Cynthia.\"No, no! that won't do,\" said Mr. Gibson, decidedly. \"You can't transfer invitations in that way. But, really, this excuse about your clothes does appear to be very trivial, Cynthia, if you have no other reason to give.\"\"It is a real, true reason to me,\" said Cynthia, looking up at him as she spoke. \"You must let me judge for myself. It would not do to go there in a state of shabbiness, for even in Doughty Street, I remember, my aunt was very particular about dress; and now that Margaret and Helen are grown up, and they visit so much,--pray don't say anything more about it, for I know it would not do.\"\"What have you done with all your money, I wonder?\" said Mrs. Gibson. \"You've twenty pounds a year, thanks to Mr. Gibson and me; and I'm sure you haven't spent more than ten.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is being offered a favor by Mr. Kirkpatrick, but she is hesitant to accept because she feels her clothes are not suitable for the occasion. Mr. Gibson suggests that Cynthia should let him judge if her reason is valid, but Cynthia insists that she knows best. Mrs. Gibson questions why Cynthia hasn't spent more of her money, as she only spends ten pounds out of her twenty-pound yearly allowance.\n","------\n","\n","\n","536\n","\"I don't understand it at all,\" said Mrs. Gibson. \"Do you, Molly?\"\"No. I know she doesn't like spending money on her dress, and is very careful.\" Molly said this much, and then was afraid she had made mischief.\"But then she must have got the money somewhere. It always has struck me that if you have not extravagant habits, and do not live up to your income, you must have a certain sum to lay by at the end of the year. Have I not often said so, Mr. Gibson?\"\"Probably.\"\"Well, then, apply the same reasoning to Cynthia's case; and then, I ask, what has become of the money?\"\"I cannot tell,\" said Molly, seeing that she was appealed to. \"She may have given it away to some one who wants it.\"Mr. Gibson put down his newspaper.\"It's very clear that she has neither got the dress nor the money necessary for this London visit, and that she doesn't want any more inquiries to be made on the subject. She likes mysteries, in fact, and I detest them. Still, I think it's a desirable thing for her to keep up the acquaintance, or friendship, or whatever it is to be called, with her father's family; and I shall gladly give her ten pounds; and if that's not enough, why, either you must help her out, or she must do without some superfluous article of dress or another.\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson and Molly are discussing Cynthia's financial situation. Cynthia is careful with her money and doesn't like spending it on clothes. However, she must have some money saved up because she doesn't live extravagantly. Mrs. Gibson wonders where Cynthia's money has gone if she doesn't have enough for a dress and a trip to London. Molly suggests that Cynthia may have given the money away to someone in need. Mr. Gibson interrupts and suggests that Cynthia likes mysteries and doesn't want anyone to\n","------\n","\n","\n","537\n","Something very like \"Pshaw!\" was growled out from behind the newspaper.\"May I go and tell her?\" said Molly, rising up.\"Yes, do, love. Tell her it would be so ungrateful to refuse; and tell her that your father wishes her to go; and tell her, too, that it would be quite wrong not to avail herself of an opening which may by-and-by be extended to the rest of the family. I am sure if they ask me--which certainly they ought to do--I won't say before they asked Cynthia, because I never think of myself, and am really the most forgiving person in the world, in forgiving slights;--but when they do ask me, which they are sure to do, I shall never be content till, by putting in a little hint here and a little hint there, I've induced them to send you an invitation. A month or two in London would do you so much good, Molly.\"Molly had left the room before this speech was ended, and Mr. Gibson was occupied with his newspaper; but Mrs. Gibson finished it to herself very much to her own satisfaction; for, after all, it was better to have some one of the family going on the visit, though she might not be the right person, than to refuse it altogether, and never to have the opportunity of saying anything about it. As Mr. Gibson was so kind to Cynthia, she too would be kind to Molly, and dress her becomingly, and invite young men to the house; do all the things, in fact, which Molly and her father did not want to have done, and throw the old stumbling-blocks in the way of their unrestrained intercourse, which was the one thing they desired to have, free and open, and without the constant dread of her jealousy.\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is speaking to Molly about an invitation she received to go to London. Mrs. Gibson wants Molly to go instead, and tries to convince her by saying it would be ungrateful to refuse and that it would be wrong not to take advantage of an opportunity that may be extended to the rest of the family. Molly leaves the room and Mrs. Gibson is satisfied with her own speech, believing it is better to have someone from the family go on the visit. She plans to be kind\n","------\n","\n","\n","538\n","XXXIX.SECRET THOUGHTS OOZE OUT.Molly found Cynthia in the drawing-room, standing in the bow-window, looking out on the garden. She started as Molly came up to her.\"Oh, Molly,\" said she, putting her arms out towards her, \"I am always so glad to have you with me!\"It was outbursts of affection such as these that always called Molly back, if she had been ever so unconsciously wavering in her allegiance to Cynthia. She had been wishing downstairs that Cynthia would be less reserved, and not have so many secrets; but now it seemed almost like treason to have wanted her to be anything but what she was. Never had any one more than Cynthia the power spoken of by Goldsmith when he wrote--He threw off his friends like a huntsman his pack,         For he knew when he liked he could whistle them back.\"Do you know, I think you'll be glad to hear what I've got to tell you,\" said Molly. \"I think you would really like to go to London; shouldn't you?\"\"Yes, but it's of no use liking,\" said Cynthia. \"Don't you begin about it, Molly, for the thing is settled; and I can't tell you why, but I can't go.\"\n","------\n","Molly finds Cynthia in the drawing-room, and Cynthia expresses her affection for Molly. Molly had been wishing that Cynthia would be less reserved and have fewer secrets, but now she feels guilty for wanting Cynthia to change. Molly then tells Cynthia that she thinks she would like to go to London, but Cynthia says it's settled and she can't go, although she doesn't provide a reason why.\n","------\n","\n","\n","539\n","\"How kind he is!\" said Cynthia. \"But I ought not to take it. I wish I had known you years ago; I should have been different to what I am.\"\"Never mind that! We like you as you are; we don't want you different. You'll really hurt papa if you don't take it. Why do you hesitate? Do you think Roger won't like it?\"\"Roger! no, I wasn't thinking about him! Why should he care? I shall be there and back again before he even hears about it.\"\"Then you will go?\" said Molly.Cynthia thought for a minute or two. \"Yes, I will,\" said she, at length. \"I daresay it's not wise; but it will be pleasant, and I'll go. Where is Mr. Gibson? I want to thank him. Oh, how kind he is! Molly, you're a lucky girl!\"\"I?\" said Molly, quite startled at being told this; for she had been feeling as if so many things were going wrong, almost as if they would never go right again.\"There he is!\" said Cynthia. \"I hear him in the hall!\" And down she flew, and laying her hands on Mr. Gibson's arm, she thanked him with such warm impulsiveness, and in so pretty and caressing a manner, that something of his old feeling of personal liking for her returned, and he forgot for a time the causes of disapproval he had against her.\n","------\n","Cynthia is grateful for Mr. Gibson's kindness and wishes she had known him earlier. Molly reassures Cynthia that they like her as she is and encourages her to accept Mr. Gibson's offer. Cynthia hesitates but ultimately decides to accept the offer. She expresses her gratitude to Mr. Gibson, which momentarily softens his disapproval of her.\n","------\n","\n","\n","540\n","\"I do think your father is the most charming man I know,\" said Cynthia, on her return to Molly; \"and it's that which always makes me so afraid of losing his good opinion, and fret so when I think he is displeased with me. And now let us think all about this London visit. It will be delightful, won't it? I can make ten pounds go ever so far; and in some ways it will be such a comfort to get out of Hollingford.\"\"Will it?\" said Molly, rather wistfully.\"Oh, yes! You know I don't mean that it will be a comfort to leave you; that will be anything but a comfort. But, after all, a country town is a country town, and London is London. You need not smile at my truisms; I've always had a sympathy with M. de la Palisse,--M. de la Palisse est mort       En perdant sa vie;    Un quart d'heure avant sa mort       Il Ätait en vie,\"sang she, in so gay a manner that she puzzled Molly, as she often did, by her change of mood from the gloomy decision with which she had refused to accept the invitation only half an hour ago. She suddenly took Molly round the waist, and began waltzing round the room with her, to the imminent danger of the various little tables, loaded with \"_objets d'art_\" (as Mrs. Gibson delighted to call them) with which the drawing-room was crowded. She avoided them, however, with her usual skill; but they both stood still at last, surprised at Mrs. Gibson's surprise, as she stood at the door, looking at the whirl going on before her.\n","------\n","Cynthia expresses her fear of losing the good opinion of Molly's father and her excitement about an upcoming trip to London. Molly is wistful about leaving Hollingford but Cynthia reassures her that London will be a welcome change. Cynthia then changes her mood and starts dancing with Molly in the crowded drawing-room, surprising Mrs. Gibson.\n","------\n","\n","\n","541\n","\"Only because I'm so glad I'm going to London, mamma,\" said Cynthia, demurely.\"I'm not sure if it's quite the thing for an engaged young lady to be so much beside herself at the prospect of gaiety. In my time, our great pleasure in our lovers' absence was in thinking about them.\"\"I should have thought that would have given you pain, because you would have had to remember that they were away, which ought to have made you unhappy. Now, to tell you the truth, just at the moment I had forgotten all about Roger. I hope it wasn't very wrong. Osborne looks as if he did all my share as well as his own of the fretting after Roger. How ill he looked yesterday!\"\"Yes,\" said Molly; \"I didn't know if any one besides me had noticed it. I was quite shocked.\"\"Ah,\" said Mrs. Gibson, \"I'm afraid that young man won't live long--very much afraid,\" and she shook her head ominously.\"Oh, what will happen if he dies!\" exclaimed Molly, suddenly sitting down, and thinking of that strange, mysterious wife who never made her appearance, whose very existence was never spoken about--and Roger away too!\n","------\n","Cynthia is excited about going to London, but her mother thinks it's inappropriate for an engaged woman to be so excited about gaiety. Cynthia's mother reminisces about how in her time, women would think about their lovers when they were away. Cynthia admits that she had forgotten about her fiancé, Roger, and hopes it wasn't wrong. Molly and Mrs. Gibson express concern about Osborne's health and worry about what will happen if he dies, as well as the mysterious wife who never\n","------\n","\n","\n","542\n","\"Don't speak of that in the same breath as Osborne's life, mamma,\" said Cynthia, hastily.\"Why, my dear, it is a very natural thought. For poor Roger's sake, you know, one wishes it not to be so very, very long an engagement; and I was only answering Molly's question, after all. One can't help following out one's thoughts. People must die, you know--young, as well as old.\"\"If I ever suspected Roger of following out his thoughts in a similar way,\" said Cynthia, \"I'd never speak to him again.\"\"As if he would!\" said Molly, warm in her turn. \"You know he never would; and you shouldn't suppose it of him, Cynthia--no, not even for a moment!\"\"I can't see the great harm of it all, for my part,\" said Mrs. Gibson, plaintively. \"A young man strikes us all as looking very ill--and I'm sure I'm sorry for it; but illness very often leads to death. Surely you agree with me there, and what's the harm of saying so? Then Molly asks what will happen if he dies; and I try to answer her question. I don't like talking or thinking of death any more than any one else; but I should think myself wanting in strength of mind if I could not look forward to the consequences of death. I really think we're commanded to do so, somewhere in the Bible or the Prayer-book.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, the characters are having a conversation about the topic of death. Cynthia is upset that her mother is discussing death in relation to Roger's engagement, while Molly defends Roger and believes he would never think that way. Mrs. Gibson argues that it is natural to consider the consequences of death and believes it is important to do so.\n","------\n","\n","\n","543\n","\"You really are the most unfeeling girl I ever met with,\" said Mrs. Gibson, really hurt. \"I wish I could give you a little of my own sensitiveness, for I have too much for my happiness. Don't let us speak of Osborne's looks again; ten to one it was only some temporary over-fatigue, or some anxiety about Roger, or perhaps a little fit of indigestion. I was very foolish to attribute it to anything more serious, and dear papa might be displeased if he knew I had done so. Medical men don't like other people to be making conjectures about health; they consider it as trenching on their own particular province, and very proper, I'm sure. Now let us consider about your dress, Cynthia; I could not understand how you had spent your money, and made so little show with it.\"\"Mamma! it may sound very cross, but I must tell Molly, and you, and everybody, once for all, that as I don't want and didn't ask for more than my allowance, I'm not going to answer any questions about what I do with it.\" She did not say this with any want of respect; but she said it with quiet determination, which subdued her mother for the time; though often afterwards, when Mrs. Gibson and Molly were alone, the former would start the wonder as to what Cynthia could possibly have done with her money, and hunt each poor conjecture through woods and valleys of doubt, till she was wearied out; and the exciting sport was given up for the day. At present, however, she confined herself to the practical matter in hand; and the genius for millinery and dress, inherent in both mother and daughter, soon settled a great many knotty points of contrivance and taste, and then they all three set to work to \"gar auld claes look amaist as weel's the new.\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is upset with her daughter, Cynthia, for being unfeeling.

His words were strong in meaning, but formal in expression; she herself did not think much about them, being satisfied to do the kind actions that called them forth. But her mother criticised them and pondered them. She thought she had hit on the truth when she decided in her own mind that it was a very old-fashioned style, and that he and his house and his furniture all wanted some of the brightening up and polishing which they were sure to receive, when--she never quite liked to finish the sentence definitely, although she kept repeating to herself that \"there was no harm in it.\"To return to the Squire. Occupied as he now was, he recovered his former health, and something of his former cheerfulness. If Osborne had met him half-way, it is probable that the old bond between father and son might have been renewed; but Osborne either was really an invalid, or had sunk into invalid habits, and made no effort to rally. If his father urged him to go out--nay, once or twice he gulped down his pride, and asked Osborne to accompany him--Osborne would go to the window and find out some flaw or speck in the wind or weather, and make that an excuse for stopping in-doors over his books. He would saunter out on the sunny side of the house in a manner that the Squire considered as both indolent and unmanly. Yet if there was a prospect of his leaving home, which he did pretty often about this time, he was seized with a hectic energy: the clouds in the sky, the easterly wind, the dampness of the air, were nothing to him then; and as the Squire did not know the real secret cause of this anxiety to be gone, he took it into his head that it arose from Osborne's dislike to Hamley and to the monotony of his father's society.\n","------\n","The Squire receives notes from Cynthia, who is hearing from Roger.

It was on one wet Sunday afternoon, when the father and son were sitting together in the large empty drawing-room. Osborne had not been to church in the morning; the Squire had, and he was now trying hard to read one of Blair's sermons. They had dined early; they always did on Sundays; and either that, or the sermon, or the hopeless wetness of the day, made the afternoon seem interminably long to the Squire. He had certain unwritten rules for the regulation of his conduct on Sundays. Cold meat, sermon-reading, no smoking till after evening prayers, as little thought as possible as to the state of the land and the condition of the crops, and as much respectable sitting in-doors in his best clothes as was consistent with going to church twice a day, and saying the responses louder than the clerk. To-day it had rained so unceasingly that he had remitted the afternoon church; but oh, even with the luxury of a nap, how long it seemed before he saw the Hall servants trudging homewards, along the field-path, a covey of umbrellas! He had been standing at the window for the last half-hour, his hands in his pockets, and his mouth often contracting itself into the traditional sin of a whistle, but as often checked into sudden gravity--ending, nine times out of ten, in a yawn. He looked askance at Osborne, who was sitting near the fire absorbed in a book. The poor Squire was something like the little boy in the child's story, who asks all sorts of birds and beasts to come and play with him; and, in every case, receives the sober answer, that they are too busy to have leisure for trivial amusements. The father wanted the son to put down his book, and talk to him: it was so wet, so dull, and a little conversation would so wile away the time! But Osborne, with his back to the window where his father was standing, saw nothing of all this, and went on reading. He had assented to his father's remark that it was a very wet afternoon, but had not carried on the subject into all the varieties of truisms of which it was susceptible. Something more rousing must be started, and this the Squire felt. The recollection of the affair between Roger and Cynthia came into his head, and, without giving it a moment's consideration, he began,--\n","------\n","The Squire and his son Osborne are spending a rainy Sunday afternoon together.

Do you know anything about this--this attachment of Roger's?\"Quite successful. Osborne laid down his book in a moment, and turned round to his father.\"Roger! an attachment! No!

He is though. Can you guess who to? Nobody that I particularly like--not a connection to my mind--yet she's a very pretty girl; and I suppose I was to blame in the first instance.\"\"Is it--?\"\"It's no use beating about the bush. I've gone so far, I may as well tell you all. It's Miss Kirkpatrick, Gibson's stepdaughter. But it's not an engagement, mind you--\"\"I'm very glad--I hope she likes Roger back again--\"\"Like--it's only too good a connection for her not to like it: if Roger is of the same mind when he comes home, I'll be bound she'll be only too happy!\"\"I wonder Roger never told me,\" said Osborne, a little hurt, now he began to consider himself.\n","------\n","Osborne's father informs him about Roger's attachment to a girl named Cynthia Kirkpatrick. Osborne is surprised and denies having any knowledge of it, although he suspects that Cynthia is the person in question.

Osborne feels hurt that Roger never told him about it.\n","------\n","\n","\n","548\n","\"I beg your pardon for interrupting you, but, once for all, I claim the right of choosing my wife for myself, subject to no man's interference,\" said Osborne, hotly.\"Then you'll keep your wife with no man's interference, that's all; for ne'er a penny will you get from me, my lad, unless you marry to please me a little, as well as yourself a great deal. That's all I ask of you. I'm not particular as to beauty, or as to cleverness, and piano-playing, and that sort of thing; if Roger marries this girl, we shall have enough of that in the family. I shouldn't much mind her being a bit older than you, but she must be well-born, and the more money she brings the better for the old place.\"\"I say again, father, I choose my wife for myself, and I don't admit any man's right of dictation.\"\"Well, well!\" said the Squire, getting a little angry in his turn. \"If I'm not to be father in this matter, thou sha'n't be son. Go against me in what I've set my heart on, and you'll find there's the devil to pay, that's all.

However, his father insists that he must marry someone who pleases him as well, and who is well-born and brings money to the family.

The Squire warns Osborne that going against his wishes will have consequences, but suggests they calm down and continue their conversation.\n","------\n","\n","\n","549\n","\"As I was saying, Gibson said, when first we spoke about it, that there was nothing on foot between any of you four, and that if there was, he would let me know; so by-and-by he comes and tells me of this.\"\"Of what--I don't understand how far it has gone?\"There was a tone in Osborne's voice the Squire did not quite like; and he began answering rather angrily.\"Of this, to be sure--of what I'm telling you--of Roger going and making love to this girl, that day he left, after he had gone away from here, and was waiting for the 'Umpire' in Hollingford. One would think you quite stupid at times, Osborne.\"\"I can only say that these details are quite new to me; you never mentioned them before, I assure you.\"\"Well; never mind whether I did or not. I'm sure I said Roger was attached to Miss Kirkpatrick, and be hanged to her; and you might have understood all the rest as a matter of course.\"\"Possibly,\" said Osborne, politely. \"May I ask if Miss Kirkpatrick, who appeared to me to be a very nice girl, responds to Roger's affection?\"\n","------\n","The Squire is speaking to Osborne about a conversation he had with Gibson. Gibson had previously told the Squire that there was nothing going on between the four of them, but now he is informing the Squire about Roger's romantic involvement with a girl named Miss Kirkpatrick.

Osborne then asks if Miss Kirkpatrick reciprocates\n","------\n","\n","\n","550\n","\"Father, don't talk so,\" said Osborne. \"I'll do anything I can to oblige you, except--\"\"Except the only thing I've set my heart on your doing.\"\"Well, well, let it alone for the present. There's no question of my marrying just at this moment. I'm out of health, and I'm not up to going into society, and meeting young ladies and all that sort of thing, even if I had an opening into fitting society.\"\"You should have an opening fast enough. There'll be more money coming in, in a year or two, please God. And as for your health, why, what's to make you well, if you cower over the fire all day, and shudder away from a good honest tankard as if it were poison?\"\"So it is to me,\" said Osborne, languidly, playing with his book as if he wanted to end the conversation and take it up again. The Squire saw the movements, and understood them.\"Well,\" said he, \"I'll go and have a talk with Will about poor old Black Bess. It's Sunday work enough, asking after a dumb animal's aches and pains.\"But after his father had left the room Osborne did not take up his book again. He laid it down on the table by him, leant back in his chair, and covered his eyes with his hand. He was in a state of health which made him despondent about many things, though, least of all, about what was most in danger. The long concealment of his marriage from his father made the disclosure of it far, far more difficult than it would have been at first. Unsupported by Roger, how could he explain it all to one so passionate as the Squire? how tell of the temptation, the stolen marriage, the consequent happiness, and alas! the consequent suffering?--for Osborne had suffered, and did suffer, greatly in the untoward circumstances in which he had placed himself. He saw no way out of it all, excepting by the one strong stroke of which he felt himself incapable. So with a heavy heart he addressed himself to his book again. Everything seemed to come in his way, and he was not strong enough in character to overcome obstacles. The only overt step he took in consequence of what he had heard from his father, was to ride over to Hollingford the first fine day after he had received the news, and go to see Cynthia and the Gibsons. He had not been there for a long time; bad weather and languor combined had prevented him. He found them full of preparations and discussions about Cynthia's visit to London; and she herself not at all in the sentimental mood proper to respond to his delicate intimations of how glad he was in his brother's joy. Indeed, it was so long after the time, that Cynthia scarcely perceived that to him the intelligence was recent, and that the first bloom of his emotions had not yet passed away. With her head a little on one side, she was contemplating the effect of a knot of ribbons, when he began, in a low whisper, and leaning forward towards her as he spoke,--\"Cynthia--I may call you Cynthia now, mayn't I?--I'm so glad of this news; I've only just heard of it, but I'm so glad!\"\n","------\n","Osborne is having a conversation with his father about getting married. His father wants him to marry a specific person, but Osborne is not interested. Osborne is also not feeling well and does not want to socialize.

Osborne is hesitant to reveal that he is already married and is unsure how to explain the situation to his father. He feels trapped and unsure of how to proceed\n","------\n","\n","\n","551\n","This light way of taking his tender congratulation did not quite please Osborne, who was in a sentimental mood, and for a minute or so he remained silent. Then, having finished making her bow of ribbon, she turned to him, and continued in a quick low voice, anxious to take advantage of a conversation between her mother and Molly,--\"I think I can guess why you made that pretty little speech just now. But do you know you ought not to have been told? And, moreover, things are not quite arrived at the solemnity of--of--well--an engagement. He would not have it so. Now, I sha'n't say any more; and you must not. Pray remember you ought not to have known; it is my own secret, and I particularly wished it not to be spoken about; and I don't like its being so talked about. Oh, the leaking of water through one small hole!\"And then she plunged into the talk of the other two, making the conversation general. Osborne was rather discomfited at the non-success of his congratulations; he had pictured to himself the unbosoming of a love-sick girl, full of rapture, and glad of a sympathizing confidant. He little knew Cynthia's nature. The more she suspected that she was called upon for a display of emotion, the less would she show; and her emotions were generally under the control of her will. He had made an effort to come and see her; and now he leant back in his chair, weary and a little dispirited.\n","------\n","Osborne is in a sentimental mood and congratulates Osborne, but she does not respond positively.

She had a trick of producing the first sketch of any new plan before an outsider to the family circle; so that the first emotions of others, if they disapproved of her projects, had to be repressed, until the idea had become familiar to them. To Molly it seemed too charming a proposal ever to come to pass. She had never allowed herself to recognize the restraint she was under in her stepmother's presence; but all at once she found it out when her heart danced at the idea of three whole days--for that it would be at the least--of perfect freedom of intercourse with her father; of old times come back again; of meals without perpetual fidgetiness after details of ceremony and correctness of attendance.\"We'll have bread-and-cheese for dinner, and eat it on our knees; we'll make up for having had to eat sloppy puddings with a fork instead of a spoon all this time, by putting our knives in our mouths till we cut ourselves. Papa shall pour his tea into his saucer if he's in a hurry; and if I'm thirsty, I'll take the slop-basin. And oh, if I could but get, buy, borrow, or steal any kind of an old horse; my grey skirt isn't new, but it will do;--that would be too delightful! After all, I think I can be happy again; for months and months it has seemed as if I had got too old ever to feel pleasure, much less happiness again.\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson suggests to Cynthia that they go to London for a few days. Molly is excited about the idea because it means she will have some freedom from her stepmother.

I often think what interlopers we must seem, and are in fact--\"\"I don't feel you as such. You, at any rate, have been a new delight to me--a sister; and I never knew how charming such a relationship could be.\"\"But mamma?\" said Cynthia, half-suspiciously, half-sorrowfully.\"She is papa's wife,\" said Molly, quietly. \"I don't mean to say I'm not often very sorry to feel I'm no longer first with him; but it was\"--the violent colour flushed into her face till even her eyes burnt, and she suddenly found herself on the point of crying; the weeping ash-tree, the misery, the slow dropping comfort, and the comforter came all so vividly before her--\"it was Roger!\"--she went on looking up at Cynthia, as she overcame her slight hesitation at mentioning his name--\"Roger, who told me how I ought to take papa's marriage, when I was first startled and grieved at the news.

But I'm not particular, papa. I think I could manage somehow.\"\"Thank you. But I'm not quite going to return into barbarism. It may be a depraved taste, but I should like to see my daughter properly mounted.\"\"Think of riding together down the lanes--why, the dog-roses must be all out in flower, and the honeysuckles, and the hay--how I should like to see Merriman's farm again! Papa, do let me have one ride with you! Please do. I'm sure we can manage it somehow.\"And \"somehow\" it was managed. \"Somehow\" all Molly's wishes came to pass; there was only one little drawback to this week of holiday and happy intercourse with her father. Everybody would ask them out to tea. They were quite like bride and bridegroom; for the fact was, that the late dinners which Mrs. Gibson had introduced into her own house, were a great inconvenience in the calculations of the small tea-drinkings at Hollingford. How ask people to tea at six, who dined at that hour? How, when they refused cake and sandwiches at half-past eight, how induce other people who were really hungry to commit a vulgarity before those calm and scornful eyes? So there had been a great lull of invitations for the Gibsons to Hollingford tea-parties. Mrs. Gibson, whose object was to squeeze herself into \"county society,\" had taken this being left out of the smaller festivities with great equanimity; but Molly missed the kind homeliness of the parties to which she had gone from time to time as long as she could remember; and though, as each three-cornered note was brought in, she grumbled a little over the loss of another charming evening with her father, she really was glad to go again in the old way among old friends. Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe were especially compassionate towards her in her loneliness. If they had had their will she would have dined there every day; and she had to call upon them very frequently in order to prevent their being hurt at her declining the dinners. Mrs. Gibson wrote twice during her week's absence to her husband. That piece of news was quite satisfactory to the Miss Brownings, who had of late held themselves a great deal aloof from a house where they chose to suppose that their presence was not wanted. In their winter evenings they had often talked over Mr. Gibson's household, and having little besides conjecture to go upon, they found the subject interminable, as they could vary the possibilities every day. One of their wonders was how Mr. and Mrs. Gibson really got on together; another was whether Mrs. Gibson was extravagant or not. Now two letters during the week of her absence showed what was in those days considered a very proper amount of conjugal affection. Yet not too much--at elevenpence-halfpenny postage. A third letter would have been extravagant. Sister looked to sister with an approving nod as Molly named the second letter, which arrived in Hollingford the very day before Mrs. Gibson was to return. They had settled between themselves that two letters would show the right amount of good feeling and proper understanding in the Gibson family: more would have been extravagant; only one would have been a mere matter of duty. There had been rather a question between Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe as to which person the second letter (supposing it came) was to be addressed to. It would be very conjugal to write twice to Mr. Gibson; and yet it would be very pretty if Molly came in for her share.\n","------\n","Molly wants a new side-saddle for her horse, but her father wants her to be properly mounted.

And what does Cynthia say? Is she enjoying herself?\"\"Oh, yes, I think so. They've had a dinner-party; and one night, when mamma was at Lady Cumnor's, Cynthia went to the play with her cousins.\"\"Upon my word! and all in one week? I do call that dissipation. Why, Thursday would be taken up with the journey, and Friday with resting, and Sunday is Sunday all the world over; and they must have written on Tuesday. Well! I hope Cynthia won't find Hollingford dull, that's all, when she comes back.\"\"I don't think it's likely,\" said Miss Phoebe, with a little simper and a knowing look, which sate oddly on her kindly innocent face. \"You see a great deal of Mr. Preston, don't you, Molly?\"\"Mr. Preston!\" said Molly, flushing up with surprise. \"No! not much. He's been at Ashcombe all winter, you know! He has but just come back to settle here. What should make you think so?\"\n","------\n","Cynthia has written a letter to the speaker and their father on a large sheet of paper. The speaker mentions that Cynthia has been enjoying herself, attending a dinner party and going to the play with her cousins.

Miss Phoebe brings up Mr. Preston and asks Molly if she sees him often, to which Molly denies and expresses surprise.\n","------\n","\n","\n","560\n","\"The little bird was flying about one day in Heath Lane, and it saw Mr. Preston and a young lady--we won't say who--walking together in a very friendly manner, that is to say, he was on horseback; but the path is raised above the road, just where there is the little wooden bridge over the brook--\"\"Perhaps Molly is in the secret, and we ought not to ask her about it,\" said Miss Phoebe, seeing Molly's extreme discomfiture and annoyance.\"It can be no great secret,\" said Miss Browning, dropping the little-bird formula, and assuming an air of dignified reproval at Miss Phoebe's interruption, \"for Miss Hornblower says Mr. Preston owns to being engaged--\"\"At any rate it isn't to Cynthia, that I know positively,\" said Molly with some vehemence. \"And pray put a stop to any such reports; you don't know what mischief they may do. I do so hate that kind of chatter!\" It was not very respectful of Molly to speak in this way to be sure, but she thought only of Roger; and the distress any such reports might cause, should he ever hear of them (in the centre of Africa!) made her colour up scarlet with vexation.\n","------\n","The little bird sees Mr. Preston and a young lady walking together in a friendly manner. Miss Phoebe suggests that Molly may know something about it, but Miss Browning interrupts and mentions that Miss Hornblower says Mr. Preston is engaged.

She worries about the potential harm these rumors could cause Roger, who is in Africa.\n","------\n","\n","\n","561\n","\"I beg your pardon,\" said Molly, only half-penitent.\"I daresay you did not mean to speak so to sister,\" said Miss Phoebe, trying to make peace.Molly did not answer all at once. She wanted to explain how much mischief might be done by such reports.\"But don't you see,\" she went on, still flushed by vexation, \"how bad it is to talk of such things in such a way? Supposing one of them cared for some one else, and that might happen, you know; Mr. Preston, for instance, may be engaged to some one else?\"\"Molly! I pity the woman! Indeed I do. I have a very poor opinion of Mr. Preston,\" said Miss Browning, in a warning tone of voice; for a new idea had come into her head.\"Well, but the woman, or young lady, would not like to hear such reports about Mr. Preston.\"\"Perhaps not. But for all that, take my word for it, he's a great flirt, and young ladies had better not have much to do with him.\"\"I daresay it was all accident their meeting in Heath Lane,\" said Miss Phoebe.\"I know nothing about it,\" said Molly, \"and I daresay I have been impertinent, only please don't talk about it any more. I have my reasons for asking you.\" She got up, for by the striking of the church clock she had just found out that it was later than she had thought, and she knew that her father would be at home by this time. She bent down and kissed Miss Browning's grave and passive face.\n","------\n","Molly is apologizing for speaking rudely to her sister and trying to explain the potential harm of spreading rumors.

As soon as she was fairly gone, Miss Browning got up and shut the door quite securely, and then sitting down near her sister, she said, in a low voice, \"Phoebe, it was Molly herself that was with Mr. Preston in Heath Lane that day when Mrs. Goodenough saw them together!\"\"Gracious goodness me!\" exclaimed Miss Phoebe, receiving it at once as gospel. \"How do you know?\"\"By putting two and two together. Didn't you notice how red Molly went, and then pale, and how she said she knew for a fact that Mr. Preston and Cynthia Kirkpatrick were not engaged?\"\"Perhaps not engaged; but Mrs. Goodenough saw them loitering together, all by their own two selves--\"\"Mrs. Goodenough only crossed Heath Lane at the Shire Oak, as she was riding in her phaeton,\" said Miss Browning sententiously. \"We all know what a coward she is in a carriage, so that most likely she had only half her wits about her, and her eyes are none of the best when she is standing steady on the ground. Molly and Cynthia have got their new plaid shawls just alike, and they trim their bonnets alike, and Molly is grown as tall as Cynthia since Christmas. I was always afraid she'd be short and stumpy, but she's now as tall and slender as anyone need be. I'll answer for it, Mrs. Goodenough saw Molly, and took her for Cynthia.\"\n","------\n","Miss Browning tells her sister, Miss Phoebe, that Molly was seen with Mr. Preston in Heath Lane by Mrs. Goodenough. Miss Browning deduces this from Molly's behavior and her denial of Mr. Preston's engagement to Cynthia Kirkpatrick.

However, we'd better say nothing about it to Mrs. Goodenough; she has got Cynthia into her head, and there let her rest. Time enough to set reports afloat about Molly when we know there's some truth in them. Mr. Preston might do for Cynthia, who's been brought up in France, though she has such pretty manners; but it may have made her not particular. He must not, and he shall not, have Molly, if I go into church and forbid the banns myself; but I'm afraid--I'm afraid there's something between her and him. We must keep on the look-out, Phoebe. I'll be her guardian angel, in spite of herself.\"\n","------\n","Miss Browning is upset with Phoebe for using the word \"drunkard\" to describe someone. Phoebe is concerned that Molly Gibson may be involved with someone named Mr. Preston. Miss Browning is determined to protect Molly and prevent her from marrying Mr. Preston.\n","------\n","\n","\n","565\n","XLI.GATHERING CLOUDS.Mrs. Gibson came back full of rose-coloured accounts of London. Lady Cumnor had been gracious and affectionate, \"so touched by my going up to see her so soon after her return to England,\" Lady Harriet charming and devoted to her old governess, Lord Cumnor \"just like his dear usual hearty self;\" and as for the Kirkpatricks, no Lord Chancellor's house was ever grander than theirs, and the silk gown of the Q.C. had floated over housemaids and footmen. Cynthia, too, was so much admired; and as for her dress, Mrs. Kirkpatrick had showered down ball-dresses and wreaths, and pretty bonnets and mantles, like a fairy godmother. Mr. Gibson's poor present of ten pounds shrank into very small dimensions compared with all this munificence.\"And they're so fond of her, I don't know when we shall have her back,\" was Mrs. Gibson's winding-up sentence. \"And now, Molly, what have you and papa been doing? Very gay, you sounded in your letter. I had not time to read it in London; so I put it in my pocket, and read it in the coach coming home. But, my dear child, you do look so old-fashioned with your gown made all tight, and your hair all tumbling about in curls. Curls are quite gone out. We must do your hair differently,\" she continued, trying to smooth Molly's black waves into straightness.\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson returns from London with positive accounts of her visit. Lady Cumnor, Lady Harriet, and Lord Cumnor were all kind and welcoming. The Kirkpatricks' house was grand, and Cynthia was admired and showered with gifts. Mrs. Gibson mentions that Molly looks old-fashioned and tries to straighten her hair.\n","------\n","\n","\n","566\n","\"Oh, yes, poor child! It made her very uneasy, I think; she said she did not feel inclined to go to Mr. Rawson's ball, which was on that night, and for which Mrs. Kirkpatrick had given her the ball-dress. But there was really nothing for her to fidget herself about. Roger only said he had had another touch of fever, but was better when he wrote. He says every European has to be acclimatized by fever in that part of Abyssinia where he is.\"\"And did she go?\" asked Molly.\"Yes, to be sure. It is not an engagement; and if it were, it is not acknowledged. Fancy her going and saying, 'A young man that I know has been ill for a few days in Africa, two months ago, therefore I don't want to go to the ball to-night.' It would have seemed like affectation of sentiment; and if there's one thing I hate it is that.\"\"She would hardly enjoy herself,\" said Molly.\"Oh, yes, but she did. Her dress was white gauze, trimmed with lilacs, and she really did look--a mother may be allowed a little natural partiality--most lovely. And she danced every dance, although she was quite a stranger. I am sure she enjoyed herself, from her manner of talking about it next morning.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph describes a conversation between two people about a young woman who was hesitant to attend a ball because she was worried about a man named Roger who had recently had a fever in Abyssinia. However, she ultimately decides to go to the ball and enjoys herself, wearing a white gauze dress trimmed with lilacs.\n","------\n","\n","\n","567\n","\"Knows what? Oh, yes, to be sure--you mean about Roger. I daresay he doesn't, and there's no need to tell him, for I've no doubt it is all right now.\" And she went out of the room to finish her unpacking.Molly let her work fall, and sighed. \"It will be a year the day after to-morrow since he came here to propose our going to Hurst Wood, and mamma was so vexed at his calling before lunch. I wonder if Cynthia remembers it as well as I do. And now, perhaps-- Oh! Roger, Roger! I wish--I pray that you were safe home again! How could we all bear it, if--\"She covered her face with her hands, and tried to stop thinking. Suddenly she got up, as if stung by a venomous fancy.\"I don't believe she loves him as she ought, or she could not--could not have gone and danced. What shall I do if she does not? What shall I do? I can bear anything but that.\"But she found the long suspense as to his health hard enough to endure. They were not likely to hear from him for a month at least, and before that time had elapsed Cynthia would be at home again. Molly learnt to long for her return before a fortnight of her absence was over. She had had no idea that perpetual tÉte-ł-tÉtes with Mrs. Gibson could, by any possibility, be so tiresome as she found them. Perhaps Molly's state of delicate health, consequent upon her rapid growth during the last few months, made her irritable; but really often she had to get up and leave the room to calm herself down after listening to a long series of words, more frequently plaintive or discontented in tone than cheerful, and which at the end conveyed no distinct impression of either the speaker's thought or feeling. Whenever anything had gone wrong, whenever Mr. Gibson had coolly persevered in anything to which she had objected; whenever the cook had made a mistake about the dinner, or the housemaid broken any little frangible article; whenever Molly's hair was not done to her liking, or her dress did not become her, or the smell of dinner pervaded the house, or the wrong callers came, or the right callers did not come--in fact, whenever anything went wrong, poor Mr. Kirkpatrick was regretted and mourned over, nay, almost blamed, as if, had he only given himself the trouble of living, he could have helped it.\n","------\n","Molly is reminiscing about a past event where Roger proposed going to Hurst Wood. She is worried about Roger's safety and hopes that Cynthia loves him as she should. Molly finds the long wait for news about Roger's health difficult, especially with Mrs. Gibson's constant complaints. Mrs. Gibson often blames Mr. Kirkpatrick for anything that goes wrong, as if he could have prevented it.\n","------\n","\n","\n","568\n","\"I thought harpstrings required a pretty strong finger to make them sound,\" said Molly.\"My dear child, you've no more poetry in you than your father. And as for your hair! it's worse than ever. Can't you drench it in water to take those untidy twists and twirls out of it?\"\"It only makes it curl more and more when it gets dry,\" said Molly, sudden tears coming into her eyes as a recollection came before her like a picture seen long ago and forgotten for years--a young mother washing and dressing her little girl; placing the half-naked darling on her knee, and twining the wet rings of dark hair fondly round her fingers, and then, in an ecstasy of fondness, kissing the little curly head.The receipt of Cynthia's letters made very agreeable events. She did not write often, but her letters were tolerably long when they did come, and very sprightly in tone. There was constant mention made of many new names, which conveyed no idea to Molly, though Mrs. Gibson would try and enlighten her by running commentaries like the following:--\n","------\n","Molly is discussing harpstrings with someone, possibly her mother. Molly's mother criticizes her hair and suggests she drench it in water to straighten it. This triggers a memory for Molly of her mother washing and styling her hair when she was a child. Molly becomes emotional and tears come to her eyes. The paragraph then transitions to discussing letters that Molly receives from someone named Cynthia, which Molly finds enjoyable.\n","------\n","\n","\n","569\n","No more news of Roger until some time after Cynthia had returned from her London visit. She came back looking fresher and prettier than ever, beautifully dressed, thanks to her own good taste, and her cousin's generosity, full of amusing details of the gay life she had been enjoying, yet not at all out of spirits at having left it behind her. She brought home all sorts of pretty and dainty devices for Molly; a neck-ribbon made up in the newest fashion, a pattern for a tippet, a delicate pair of light gloves, embroidered as Molly had never seen gloves embroidered before, and many another little sign of remembrance during her absence. Yet somehow or other, Molly felt that Cynthia was changed in her relation to her. Molly was aware that she had never had Cynthia's full confidence, for with all her apparent frankness and _naĽvetÄ_ of manner, Cynthia was extremely reserved and reticent. She knew this much of herself, and had often laughed about it to Molly, and the latter had by this time found out the truth of her friend's assertion. But Molly did not trouble herself much about it. She too knew that there were many thoughts and feelings that flitted through her mind which she should never think of telling to any one, except perhaps--if they were ever very much thrown together--to her father. She knew that Cynthia withheld from her more than thoughts and feelings--that she withheld facts. But then, as Molly reflected, these facts might involve details of struggle and suffering--might relate to her mother's neglect--and altogether be of so painful a character, that it would be well if Cynthia could forget her childhood altogether, instead of fixing it in her mind by the relation of her grievances and troubles. So it was not now by any want of confidence that Molly felt distanced as it were. It was because Cynthia rather avoided than sought her companionship; because her eyes shunned the straight, serious, loving look of Molly's; because there were certain subjects on which she evidently disliked speaking, not particularly interesting things as far as Molly could perceive, but it almost seemed as if they lay on the road to points to be avoided. Molly felt a sort of sighing pleasure in noticing Cynthia's changed manner of talking about Roger. She spoke of him tenderly now; \"poor Roger,\" as she called him; and Molly thought that she must be referring to the illness which he had mentioned in his last letter. One morning in the first week after Cynthia's return home, just as he was going out, Mr. Gibson ran up into the drawing-room, hat on, booted and spurred, and hastily laid an open pamphlet down before her; pointing out a particular passage with his finger, but not speaking a word before he rapidly quitted the room. His eyes were sparkling, and had an amused as well as pleased expression. All this Molly noticed, as well as Cynthia's flush of colour as she read what was thus pointed out to her. Then she pushed it a little on one side, not closing the book, however, and went on with her work.\n","------\n","After Cynthia returns from her visit to London, she appears fresher and prettier than before. She brings back gifts for Molly and shares amusing stories about her time in London. However, Molly senses that Cynthia has changed in their relationship. Cynthia is reserved and avoids certain topics of conversation. Molly believes that Cynthia withholds facts and details about her past, possibly due to painful experiences. Despite this distance, Molly notices that Cynthia now speaks tenderly about Roger, possibly in reference to his illness. One morning\n","------\n","\n","\n","570\n","\"What is it? may I see it?\" asked Molly, stretching out her hand for the pamphlet, which lay within her reach. But she did not take it until Cynthia had said--\"Certainly; I don't suppose there are any great secrets in a scientific journal, full of reports of meetings.\" And she gave the book a little push towards Molly.\"Oh, Cynthia!\" said Molly, catching her breath as she read, \"are you not proud?\" For it was an account of an annual gathering of the Geographical Society, and Lord Hollingford had read a letter he had received from Roger Hamley, dated from Arracuoba, a district in Africa, hitherto unvisited by any intelligent European traveller; and about which Mr. Hamley sent many curious particulars. The reading of this letter had been received with the greatest interest, and several subsequent speakers had paid the writer very high compliments.But Molly might have known Cynthia better than to expect an answer responsive to the feelings that prompted her question. Let Cynthia be ever so proud, ever so glad, or so grateful, or even indignant, remorseful, grieved or sorry, the very fact that she was expected by another to entertain any of these emotions, would have been enough to prevent her expressing them.\n","------\n","Molly asks to see a pamphlet and Cynthia allows her to, saying there are no secrets in it. Molly reads the pamphlet and discovers it is an account of a meeting of the Geographical Society where Lord Hollingford read a letter from Roger Hamley about his travels in Africa. Molly is impressed and asks Cynthia if she is proud, but Cynthia does not respond in a way that reflects her true emotions.\n","------\n","\n","\n","571\n","\"Nonsense,\" said Molly. \"You know you don't believe what you are saying, Cynthia.\"Cynthia gave that pretty little jerk of her shoulders, which was her equivalent for a French shrug, but did not lift up her head from her sewing. Molly began to read the report over again.\"Why, Cynthia!\" she said, \"you might have been there; ladies were there. It says 'many ladies were present.' Oh, couldn't you have managed to go? If your uncle's set cared about these things, wouldn't some of them have taken you?\"\"Perhaps, if I had asked them. But I think they would have been rather astonished at my sudden turn for science.\"\"You might have told your uncle how matters really stood, he wouldn't have talked about it if you had wished him not, I am sure, and he could have helped you.\"\"Once for all, Molly,\" said Cynthia, now laying down her work, and speaking with quick authority, \"do learn to understand that it is, and always has been my wish, not to have the relation which Roger and I bear to each other, mentioned or talked about. When the right time comes, I will make it known to my uncle, and to everybody whom it may concern; but I am not going to make mischief, and get myself into trouble--even for the sake of hearing compliments paid to him--by letting it out before the time. If I'm pushed to it, I'd sooner break it off altogether at once, and have done with it. I can't be worse off than I am now.\" Her angry tone had changed into a kind of desponding complaint before she had ended her sentence. Molly looked at her with dismay.\n","------\n","Molly is trying to convince Cynthia to attend an event where ladies will be present. Cynthia is hesitant because she does not want her relationship with Roger to be talked about. She explains to Molly that she wants to keep their relationship private until the right time comes to reveal it. Cynthia expresses her frustration and suggests that she would rather end the relationship than deal with the potential trouble of revealing it prematurely. Molly is concerned and looks at Cynthia with dismay.\n","------\n","\n","\n","572\n","\"No; I daresay you can't,\" said Cynthia, looking at her with tears in her eyes, and very tenderly, as if in atonement for her late vehemence. \"I am afraid--I hope you never will.\"In a moment, Molly's arms were round her. \"Oh, Cynthia,\" she murmured, \"have I been plaguing you? Have I vexed you? Don't say you're afraid of my knowing you. Of course you've your faults, everybody has, but I think I love you the better for them.\"\"I don't know that I am so very bad,\" said Cynthia, smiling a little through the tears that Molly's words and caresses had forced to overflow from her eyes. \"But I have got into scrapes. I'm in a scrape now. I do sometimes believe I shall always be in scrapes, and if they ever come to light, I shall seem to be worse than I really am; and I know your father will throw me off, and I--no, I won't be afraid that you will, Molly.\"\"I'm sure I won't. Are they--do you think--how would Roger take it?\" asked Molly, very timidly.\"I don't know. I hope he will never hear of it. I don't see why he should, for in a little while I shall be quite clear again. It all came about without my ever thinking I was doing wrong. I've a great mind to tell you all about it, Molly.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is upset and tearful, and Molly comforts her. Cynthia expresses fear that Molly will discover something about her that she doesn't want her to know. Molly reassures Cynthia that she loves her despite her faults. Cynthia admits that she has gotten into trouble and is currently in a difficult situation. She worries that if her actions are revealed, Molly's father will reject her, but she trusts that Molly won't. Molly asks how Roger, presumably someone important to both of them, would react to\n","------\n","\n","\n","573\n","Cynthia's correspondence went on pretty briskly with her London cousins, according to the usual rate of correspondence in those days. Indeed, Mrs. Gibson was occasionally inclined to complain of the frequency of Helen Kirkpatrick's letters; for before the penny post came in, the recipient had to pay the postage of letters; and eleven-pence-halfpenny three times a week came, according to Mrs. Gibson's mode of reckoning when annoyed, to a sum \"between three and four shillings.\" But these complaints were only for the family; they saw the wrong side of the tapestry. Hollingford in general, Miss Brownings in particular, heard of \"dear Helen's enthusiastic friendship for Cynthia,\" and of \"the real pleasure it was to receive such constant news--relays of news indeed--from London. It was almost as good as living there!\"\"A great deal better I should think,\" said Miss Browning with some severity. For she had got many of her notions of the metropolis from the British Essayists, where town is so often represented as the centre of dissipation, corrupting country wives and squires' daughters, and unfitting them for all their duties by the constant whirl of its not always innocent pleasures. London was a sort of moral pitch, which few could touch and not be defiled. Miss Browning had been on the watch for the signs of deterioration in Cynthia's character ever since her return home. But, except in a greater number of pretty and becoming articles of dress, there was no great change for the worse to be perceived. Cynthia had been \"in the world,\" had \"beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of London,\" yet had come back to Hollingford as ready as ever to place a chair for Miss Browning, or to gather flowers for a nosegay for Miss Phoebe, or to mend her own clothes. But all this was set down to the merits of Cynthia, not to the credit of London-town.\n","------\n","Cynthia has been corresponding frequently with her London cousins, which annoys her mother because they have to pay for postage. However, the people in Hollingford, particularly the Miss Brownings, admire Cynthia's friendship with her London cousin and envy the constant news she receives. Miss Browning, however, is suspicious of Cynthia's character after her time in London, but she doesn't see any significant changes in her except for her improved fashion sense. The people in Hollingford attribute Cynthia's good\n","------\n","\n","\n","574\n","\"But perhaps she may live in London some of these days, Miss Browning,\" simpered Mrs. Gibson.\"Time enough then to be thinking of London. I wish her an honest country husband with enough to live upon, and a little to lay by, and a good character to boot. Mind that, Molly,\" said she, firing round upon the startled Molly; \"I wish Cynthia a husband with a good character; but she's got a mother to look after her; you've none, and when your mother was alive she was a dear friend of mine: so I'm not going to let you throw yourself away upon any one whose life isn't clear and above-board, you may depend upon it!\"This last speech fell like a bomb into the quiet little drawing-room, it was delivered with such vehemence. Miss Browning, in her secret heart, meant it as a warning against the intimacy she believed that Molly had formed with Mr. Preston; but as it happened that Molly had never dreamed of any such intimacy, the girl could not imagine why such severity of speech should be addressed to her. Mrs. Gibson, who always took up the points of every word or action where they touched her own self (and called it sensitiveness), broke the silence that followed Miss Browning's speech by saying, plaintively,--\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson suggests that Cynthia may live in London in the future, but Miss Browning dismisses the idea and wishes for Cynthia to marry a country husband with a good character. Mrs. Gibson then turns her attention to Molly, warning her not to throw herself away on someone with a questionable character. This surprises Molly, as she has not been involved in any such relationship. Mrs. Gibson then complains about Miss Browning's comment, and the paragraph ends with her speaking plaintively.\n","------\n","\n","\n","575\n","\"I did not mean to offend you, but I meant just to give Molly a hint. She understands what I mean.\"\"I'm sure I don't,\" said Molly, boldly. \"I haven't a notion what you meant, if you were alluding to anything more than you said straight out,--that you do not wish me to marry any one who hasn't a good character, and that, as you were a friend of mamma's, you would prevent my marrying a man with a bad character, by every means in your power. I'm not thinking of marrying; I don't want to marry anybody at all; but if I did, and he were not a good man, I should thank you for coming and warning me of it.\"\"I shall not stand on warning you, Molly. I shall forbid the banns in church, if need be,\" said Miss Browning, half convinced of the clear transparent truth of what Molly had said--blushing all over, it is true, but with her steady eyes fixed on Miss Browning's face while she spoke.\"Do!\" said Molly.\"Well, well, I won't say any more. Perhaps I was mistaken. We won't say any more about it. But remember what I have said, Molly; there's no harm in that, at any rate. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, Mrs. Gibson. As stepmothers go, I think you try and do your duty. Good morning. Good-by to you both, and God bless you.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Miss Browning apologizes for offending Molly and explains that she only meant to give her a hint. Molly boldly responds that she doesn't understand what Miss Browning meant and clarifies that she doesn't want to marry anyone at all.

But I know that I never was spoken to as if I was trying to do my duty before,--'trying' indeed! everybody always knew that I did it, without talking about it before my face in that rude manner. I've that deep feeling about duty that I think it ought only to be talked about in church, and in such sacred places as that; not to have a common caller startling one with it, even though she was an early friend of your mother's. And as if I didn't look after you quite as much as I look after Cynthia! Why, it was only yesterday I went up into Cynthia's room and found her reading a letter that she put away in a hurry as soon as I came in, and I didn't even ask her who it was from, and I'm sure I should have made you tell me.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, a character named Molly is being scolded by her mother for the impertinence she received from Miss Browning. Molly defends herself, saying she doesn't know why Miss Browning spoke to her that way. Molly's mother dismisses the issue, stating that she has never been spoken to in such a manner before. She believes that discussions about duty should only happen in church or other sacred places, not during a casual visit. Molly's mother also mentions that she looks\n","------\n","\n","\n","577\n","Just then Cynthia came in.\"What's the matter?\" said she quickly, seeing that something was wrong.\"Why, Molly has been doing something which has set that impertinent Miss Browning off into lecturing me on trying to do my duty! If your poor father had but lived, Cynthia, I should never have been spoken to as I have been. 'A stepmother trying to do her duty,' indeed! That was Miss Browning's expression.\"Any allusion to her father took from Cynthia all desire of irony. She came forward, and again asked Molly what was the matter.Molly, herself ruffled, made answer,--\"Miss Browning seemed to think I was likely to marry some one whose character was objectionable--\"\"You, Molly?\" said Cynthia.\"Yes--she once before spoke to me,--I suspect she has got some notion about Mr. Preston in her head--\"Cynthia sate down quite suddenly. Molly went on: \"And she spoke as if mamma did not look enough after me,--I think she was rather provoking--\"\"Not rather, but very--very impertinent,\" said Mrs. Gibson, a little soothed by Molly's recognition of her grievance.\n","------\n","Cynthia enters the room and notices that something is wrong. Mrs. Gibson explains that Molly did something that upset Miss Browning, who then lectured Mrs. Gibson about trying to do her duty as a stepmother. Mrs. Gibson expresses her frustration and mentions that Miss Browning made a comment about Molly potentially marrying someone with a questionable character. Cynthia is surprised by this and Molly explains that Miss Browning may have some concerns about Mr. Preston. Cynthia sits down in shock and Molly continues to say\n","------\n","\n","\n","578\n","\"I don't know,\" said her mother, replying to the question after her own fashion. \"I'm sure I don't always approve of Mr. Preston; but even if it was him she was thinking about, he's far more agreeable than she is; and I had much rather have him coming to call than an old maid like her any day.\"\"I don't know that it was Mr. Preston she was thinking about,\" said Molly. \"It was only a guess. When you were both in London she spoke about him,--I thought she had heard something about you and him, Cynthia.\" Unseen by her mother Cynthia looked up at Molly, her eyes full of prohibition, her cheeks full of angry colour. Molly stopped short suddenly. After that look she was surprised at the quietness with which Cynthia said, almost immediately,--\"Well, after all, it is only your fancy that she was alluding to Mr. Preston, so perhaps we had better not say any more about him; and as for her advice to mamma to look after you better, Miss Molly, I'll stand bail for your good behaviour; for both mamma and I know you're the last person to do any foolish things in that way. And now don't let us talk any more about it. I was coming to tell you that Hannah Brand's little boy has been badly burnt, and his sister is downstairs asking for old linen.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Molly and her mother are discussing someone named Mr. Preston. Molly suggests that Cynthia, who is present but not speaking, may have heard something about Cynthia and Mr. Preston while Molly and her mother were in London. Cynthia becomes angry and gives Molly a warning look. Cynthia then changes the subject and tells Molly about a child who has been badly burnt and needs old linen.\n","------\n","\n","\n","579\n","Cynthia turned quietly round to Molly.\"Molly, pray don't ever allude to anything between me and Mr. Preston,--not to mamma, nor to any one. Never do! I've a reason for it,--don't say anything more about it, ever.\"Mrs. Gibson came back at this moment, and Molly had to stop short again on the brink of Cynthia's confidence; uncertain indeed this time, whether she would have been told anything more, and only sure that she had annoyed Cynthia a good deal.But the time was approaching when she would know all.\n","------\n","Cynthia asks Molly not to mention anything about her and Mr. Preston to anyone, including their mother. Molly is unsure why Cynthia is asking this, but respects her wishes. Mrs. Gibson interrupts their conversation, preventing Molly from learning more. However, Molly knows that she will eventually find out the truth.\n","------\n","\n","\n","580\n","XLII.THE STORM BURSTS.The autumn drifted away through all its seasons. The golden corn-harvest, the walks through the stubble-fields, and rambles into hazel-copses in search of nuts; the stripping of the apple-orchards of their ruddy fruit, amid the joyous cries and shouts of watching children; and the gorgeous tulip-like colouring of the later time had now come on with the shortening days. There was comparative silence in the land, excepting for the distant shots, and the whirr of the partridges as they rose up from the field.Ever since Miss Browning's unlucky conversation, things had been ajar in the Gibsons' house. Cynthia seemed to keep every one out at (mental) arms'-length; and particularly avoided any private talks with Molly. Mrs. Gibson, still cherishing a grudge against Miss Browning for her implied accusation of not looking enough after Molly, chose to exercise a most wearying supervision over the poor girl. It was, \"Where have you been, child?\" \"Who did you see?\" \"Who was that letter from?\" \"Why were you so long out when you had only to go to so-and-so?\" just as if Molly had really been detected in carrying on some underhand intercourse. She answered every question asked of her with the simple truthfulness of perfect innocence; but the inquiries (although she read their motive, and knew that they arose from no especial suspicion of her conduct, but only that Mrs. Gibson might be able to say that she looked well after her stepdaughter) chafed her inexpressibly. Very often she did not go out at all, sooner than have to give a plan of her intended proceedings, when perhaps she had no plan at all,--only thought of wandering out at her own sweet will, and of taking pleasure in the bright solemn fading of the year. It was a very heavy time for Molly,--zest and life had fled, and left so many of the old delights mere shells of seeming. She thought it was that her youth had fled; at nineteen! Cynthia was no longer the same, somehow: and perhaps Cynthia's change would injure her in the distant Roger's opinion. Her stepmother seemed almost kind in comparison with Cynthia's withdrawal of her heart; Mrs. Gibson worried her, to be sure, with all these forms of watching over her; but in all her other ways, she, at any rate, was the same. Yet Cynthia herself seemed anxious and care-worn, though she would not speak of her anxieties to Molly. And then the poor girl in her goodness would blame herself for feeling Cynthia's change of manner; for as Molly said to herself, \"If it is hard work for me to help always fretting after Roger, and wondering where he is, and how he is, what must it be for her?\"\n","------\n","The paragraph describes the changing seasons and the strained atmosphere in the Gibsons' house. Ever since Miss Browning's conversation, Cynthia has been distant from everyone, especially Molly. Mrs. Gibson, still holding a grudge against Miss Browning, supervises Molly excessively. Molly feels frustrated by the constant questioning and sometimes chooses not to go out at all. She feels that her youth has faded and worries that Cynthia's change in behavior will affect Roger's opinion of her. Cynthia herself appears anxious and worn\n","------\n","\n","\n","581\n","\"Molly,\" said he, \"where's Cynthia?\"\"Gone out to do some errands--\"\"Well, it's a pity--but never mind. Put on your bonnet and cloak as fast as you can. I've had to borrow old Simpson's dog-cart,--there would have been room both for you and Cynthia; but as it is, you must walk back alone. I'll drive you as far on the Barford Road as I can, and then you must jump down. I can't take you on to Broadhurst's, I may be kept there for hours.\"Mrs. Gibson was out of the room; out of the house it might be, for all Molly cared, now she had her father's leave and command. Her bonnet and cloak were on in two minutes, and she was sitting by her father's side, the back seat shut up, and the light weight going swiftly and merrily bumping over the stone-paved lanes.\"Oh, this is charming!\" said Molly, after a toss-up on her seat from a tremendous bump.\"For youth, but not for crabbed age,\" said Mr. Gibson. \"My bones are getting rheumatic, and would rather go smoothly over macadamized streets.\"\"That's treason to this lovely view and this fine pure air, papa. Only I don't believe you.\"\n","------\n","Molly's father asks her where Cynthia is and learns that she has gone out to run errands. He tells Molly to quickly put on her bonnet and cloak because he has borrowed a dog-cart from someone named Simpson. He explains that there would have been room for both Molly and Cynthia, but since Cynthia is not there, Molly will have to walk back alone. He offers to drive her as far as he can on the Barford Road before she has to jump down. Molly is excited and\n","------\n","\n","\n","582\n","\"Oh, let me just go up to the top!

The woods were golden; the old house of purple-red brick, with its twisted chimneys, rose up from among them facing on to green lawns, and a placid lake; beyond again were the Malvern Hills.\"Now jump down, lassie, and make the best of your way home before it gets dark. You'll find the cut over Croston Heath shorter than the road we've come by.\"To get to Croston Heath, Molly had to go down a narrow lane overshadowed by trees, with picturesque old cottages dotted here and there on the steep sandy banks; and then there came a small wood, and then there was a brook to be crossed on a plank-bridge, and up the steeper fields on the opposite side were cut steps in the turfy path; these ended, she was on Croston Heath, a wide-stretching common skirted by labourers' dwellings, past which a near road to Hollingford lay.\n","------\n","The protagonist, Molly, decides to go up to the top of a hill to enjoy the view of the Malverns and Dorrimer Hall. After a brief rest, she plans to return home. Molly then descends the hill, passing through a narrow lane, old cottages, a small wood, and a brook. She eventually reaches Croston Heath, a common area surrounded by laborers' homes, where she can take a road to Hollingford.\n","------\n","\n","\n","583\n","For an instant no one spoke. Then Cynthia said,--\"Oh, Molly, Molly, come and judge between us!\"Mr. Preston let go Cynthia's hands slowly, with a look that was more of a sneer than a smile; and yet he, too, had been strongly agitated, whatever was the subject in dispute. Molly came forward and took Cynthia's arm, her eyes steadily fixed on Mr. Preston's face. It was fine to see the fearlessness of her perfect innocence. He could not bear her look, and said to Cynthia,--\"The subject of our conversation does not well admit of a third person's presence. As Miss Gibson seems to wish for your company now, I must beg you to fix some other time and place where we can finish our discussion.\"\"I will go if Cynthia wishes me,\" said Molly.\"No, no; stay--I want you to stay--I want you to hear it all--I wish I had told you sooner.\"\"You mean that you regret that she has not been made aware of our engagement--that you promised long ago to be my wife. Pray remember that it was you who made me promise secrecy, not I you!\"\n","------\n","Cynthia and Mr. Preston are having a heated discussion, and Cynthia calls for Molly to judge between them. Mr. Preston releases Cynthia's hands and Molly approaches, looking fearlessly at Mr. Preston. He is uncomfortable with her presence and suggests they continue their conversation without her. Molly offers to leave if Cynthia wants her to, but Cynthia insists that she stay and hear everything. Cynthia accuses Mr. Preston of regretting not telling Molly about their engagement and reminds him that he was the one who wanted\n","------\n","\n","\n","584\n","\"Cynthia,\" said he, suddenly changing his tone to fervid tenderness, \"pray, pray do not go on so; you can't think how it distresses me!\" He stepped forward to try and take her hand and soothe her; but she shrank away from him, and sobbed the more irrepressibly. She felt Molly's presence so much to be a protection that now she dared to let herself go, and to weaken herself by giving way to her emotion.\"Go away!\" said Molly. \"Don't you see you make her worse?\" But he did not stir; he was looking at Cynthia so intently that he did not seem even to hear her. \"Go,\" said Molly, vehemently, \"if it really distresses you to see her cry. Don't you see, it's you who are the cause of it?\"\"I will go if Cynthia tells me,\" said he at length.\"Oh, Molly, I don't know what to do,\" said Cynthia, taking down her hands from her tear-stained face, and appealing to Molly, and sobbing worse than ever; in fact, she became hysterical, and though she tried to speak coherently, no intelligible words would come.\"Run to that cottage in the trees, and fetch her a cup of water,\" said Molly. He hesitated a little.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Cynthia is upset and crying, and Molly is trying to comfort her. However, a man is present and seems to be the cause of Cynthia's distress.

Mr. Preston was resolute on this point. He said--\"I think since Miss Gibson has made herself acquainted with this much, we had better let her know the whole truth--that you are engaged to marry me as soon as you are twenty; otherwise your being here with me, and by appointment too, may appear strange--even equivocal to her.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is upset and crying, expressing her hatred towards someone.

I liked you then--you were almost my only friend--and, if it had been a question of immediate marriage, I daresay I should never have objected. But I know you better now; and you have persecuted me so of late, that I tell you once for all (as I have told you before, till I am sick of the very words), that nothing shall ever make me marry you. Nothing! I see there's no chance of escaping exposure and, I daresay, losing my character, and I know losing all the few friends I have.\"\"Never me,\" said Molly, touched by the wailing tone of despair that Cynthia was falling into.\"It is hard,\" said Mr. Preston. \"You may believe all the bad things you like about me, Cynthia, but I don't think you can doubt my real, passionate, disinterested love for you.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia confesses that when she was sixteen, Mr. Preston, whom she believed to be a friend, lent her money and made her promise to marry him.

Mr. Preston insists that he truly loves her, despite any negative beliefs she may have about him.\n","------\n","\n","\n","588\n","Mr. Preston broke in at the pause she made. She was afraid of revealing too much to him.\"You do not call it love which has been willing to wait for years--to be silent while silence was desired--to suffer jealousy and to bear neglect, relying on the solemn promise of a girl of sixteen--for solemn say flimsy, when that girl grows older. Cynthia, I have loved you, and I do love you, and I won't give you up. If you will but keep your word, and marry me, I'll swear I'll make you love me in return.\"\"Oh, I wish--I wish I'd never borrowed that unlucky money, it was the beginning of it all. Oh, Molly, I have saved and scrimped to repay it, and he won't take it now; I thought if I could but repay it, it would set me free.\"\"You seem to imply you sold yourself for twenty pounds,\" he said. They were nearly on the common now, close to the protection of the cottages, in very hearing of their inmates; if neither of the other two thought of this, Molly did, and resolved in her mind to call in at one of them, and ask for the labourer's protection home; at any rate his presence must put a stop to this miserable altercation.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Mr. Preston interrupts a woman who is hesitant to reveal too much to him. He expresses his love for her and insists that if she marries him, he will make her love him in return. The woman regrets borrowing money and believes it was the cause of their current situation.

They are walking near some cottages, and the woman plans to seek protection from a laborer there.\n","------\n","\n","\n","589\n","He bowed and turned back, vanishing rapidly down the field staircase. At any rate that was a relief. Yet the two girls hastened on, as if he was still pursuing them.

We shall have to look as if nothing had happened when we get home. Come to my room when we go upstairs to bed, and I'll tell you all. I know you'll blame me terribly, but I will tell you all.\"So Molly did not say another word till they reached home; and then, comparatively at ease, inasmuch as no one perceived how late was their return to the house, each of the girls went up into their separate rooms, to rest and calm themselves before dressing for the necessary family gathering at dinner. Molly felt as if she were so miserably shaken that she could not have gone down at all, if her own interests only had been at stake. She sate by her dressing-table, holding her head in her hands, her candles unlighted, and the room in soft darkness, trying to still her beating heart, and to recall all she had heard, and what would be its bearing on the lives of those whom she loved. Roger. Oh, Roger!--far away in mysterious darkness of distance--loving as he did (ah, that was love! that was the love to which Cynthia had referred, as worthy of the name!) and the object of his love claimed by another--false to one she must be! How could it be? What would he think and feel if ever he came to know it? It was of no use trying to imagine his pain--that could do no good.

It may be a weakness, or a sin,--I'm sure I don't know, and I don't care; but I really cannot be happy in the same house with any one who knows my faults, and thinks that they are greater than my merits. Now you know your father would do that. I have often told you that he (and you too, Molly,) had a higher standard than I had ever known.

I was such a child to be left all to myself. It was the holidays, and mamma was away visiting, and the Donaldsons asked me to go with them to the Worcester Festival. You can't fancy how pleasant it all sounded, especially to me. I had been shut up in that great dreary house at Ashcombe, where mamma had her school; it belonged to Lord Cumnor, and Mr. Preston as his agent had to see it all painted and papered; but, besides that, he was very intimate with us; I believe mamma thought--no, I'm not sure about that, and I have enough blame to lay at her door, to prevent my telling you anything that may be only fancy--\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is speaking to Molly and asking her to promise not to say anything more about a certain topic.

In this case she descanted largely on the enjoyment she was having, and the kindness she was receiving, and her wish that I could have been with her, and her gladness that I too was going to have some pleasure; but the only thing that would have been of real use to me she left out, and that was where she was going to next. She mentioned that she was leaving the house she was stopping at the day after she wrote, and that she should be at home by a certain date; but I got the letter on a Saturday, and the festival began the next Tuesday--\"\n","------\n","The narrator is explaining their relationship with someone who knew a lot about their mother's life.

I hardly can understand how different it must have been with you.\"\"Different! I should think so. The worry about money made me sick of my life. We might not say we were poor, it would have injured the school; but I would have stinted and starved if mamma and I had got on as happily together as we might have done--as you and Mr. Gibson do. It was not the poverty; it was that she never seemed to care to have me with her. As soon as the holidays came round she was off to some great house or another; and I daresay I was at a very awkward age to have me lounging about in the drawing-room when callers came. Girls at the age I was then are so terribly keen at scenting out motives, and putting in their disagreeable questions as to the little twistings and twirlings and vanishings of conversation; they've no distinct notion of what are the truths and falsehoods of polite life. At any rate, I was very much in mamma's way, and I felt it. Mr. Preston seemed to feel it too for me; and I was very grateful to him for kind words and sympathetic looks--crumbs of kindness which would have dropped under your table unnoticed. So this day, when he came to see how the workmen were getting on, he found me in the deserted schoolroom, looking at my faded summer bonnet and some old ribbons I had been sponging, and half-worn-out gloves--a sort of rag-fair spread out on the deal table. I was in a regular passion with only looking at that shabbiness. He said he was so glad to hear I was going to this festival with the Donaldsons; old Betty, our servant, had told him the news, I believe. But I was so perplexed about money, and my vanity was so put out about my shabby dress, that I was in a pet, and said I shouldn't go. He sate down on the table, and little by little he made me tell him all my troubles. I do sometimes think he was very nice in those days. Somehow I never felt as if it was wrong or foolish or anything to accept his offer of money at the time. He had twenty pounds in his pocket, he said, and really didn't know what to do with it,--shouldn't want it for months; I could repay it, or rather mamma could, when it suited her. She must have known I should want money, and most likely thought I should apply to him. Twenty pounds wouldn't be too much, I must take it all, and so on.

Mrs. Donaldson gave me my ticket, but she rather looked grave at my idea of going to the Ball in my white muslin, which I had already worn two evenings at their house. Oh dear! how pleasant it must be to be rich! You know,\" continued Cynthia, smiling a very little, \"I can't help being aware that I'm pretty, and that people admire me very much. I found it out first at the Donaldsons'. I began to think I did look pretty in my fine new clothes, and I saw that other people thought so too. I was certainly the belle of the house, and it was very pleasant to feel my power. The last day or two of that gay week Mr. Preston joined our party. The last time he had seen me was when I was dressed in shabby clothes too small for me, half-crying in my solitude, neglected and penniless. At the Donaldsons' I was a little queen; and as I said, fine feathers make fine birds, and all the people were making much of me; and at that Ball, which was the first night he came, I had more partners than I knew what to do with. I suppose he really did fall in love with me then. I don't think he had done so before. And then I began to feel how awkward it was to be in his debt. I couldn't give myself airs to him as I did to others. Oh! it was so awkward and uncomfortable! But I liked him, and felt him as a friend all the time. The last day I was walking in the garden along with the others, and I thought I would tell him how much I had enjoyed myself, and how happy I had been, all thanks to his twenty pounds (I was beginning to feel like Cinderella when the clock was striking twelve), and to tell him it should be repaid to him as soon as possible, though I turned sick at the thought of telling mamma, and knew enough of our affairs to understand how very difficult it would be to muster up the money. The end of our talk came very soon; for, almost to my terror, he began to talk violent love to me, and to beg me to promise to marry him. I was so frightened, that I ran away to the others. But that night I got a letter from him, apologizing for startling me, renewing his offer, his entreaties for a promise of marriage, to be fulfilled at any date I would please to name--in fact, a most urgent love-letter, and in it a reference to my unlucky debt, which was to be a debt no longer, only an advance of the money to be hereafter mine if only-- You can fancy it all, Molly, better than I can remember it to tell it you.\"\n","------\n","The protagonist, Cynthia, recounts her experiences of spending money on new clothes and attending social events.

I feel sure that she will do it; and I don't think you will dare to refuse Lord Cumnor.\"He felt at once that he should not dare; that, clever land-agent as he was, and high up in the earl's favour on that account, yet that the conduct of which he had been guilty in regard to the letters, and the threats which he had held out respecting them, were just what no gentleman, no honourable man, no manly man, could put up with in any one about him. He knew that much, and he wondered how she, the girl standing before him, had been clever enough to find it out. He forgot himself for an instant in admiration of her. There she stood, frightened, yet brave, not letting go her hold on what she meant to do, even when things seemed most against her; and besides, there was something that struck him most of all perhaps, and which shows the kind of man he was--he perceived that Molly was as unconscious that he was a young man, and she a young woman, as if she had been a pure angel of heaven. Though he felt that he would have to yield, and give up the letters, he was not going to do it at once; and while he was thinking what to say, so as still to evade making any concession till he had had time to think over it, he, with his quick senses all about him, heard the trotting of a horse cranching quickly along over the gravel of the drive. A moment afterwards, Molly's perception overtook his. He could see the startled look overspread her face; and in an instant she would have run away, but before the first rush was made, Mr. Preston laid his hand firmly on her arm.\n","------\n","Molly confronts Mr. Preston about the letters he has been withholding from her. She threatens to tell Lady Harriet and Lord Cumnor about his actions. Mr. Preston realizes that Molly is brave and determined, and he admires her for it. However, he is not ready to give up the letters yet. Just as Molly is about to run away, they both hear the sound of a horse approaching. Mr. Preston grabs Molly's arm before she can escape.\n","------\n","\n","\n","613\n","As he spoke, Mr. Sheepshanks came round the bend of the road and was close upon them. Mr. Preston saw, if Molly did not, the sudden look of intelligence that dawned upon the shrewd ruddy face of the old gentleman--saw, but did not much heed. He went forwards and spoke to Mr. Sheepshanks, who made a halt right before them.\"Miss Gibson! your servant. Rather a blustering day for a young lady to be out,--and cold, I should say, for standing still too long; eh, Preston?\" poking his whip at the latter in a knowing manner.\"Yes,\" said Mr. Preston; \"and I'm afraid I have kept Miss Gibson too long standing.\"Molly did not know what to say or do; so she only bowed a silent farewell, and turned away to go home, feeling very heavy at heart at the non-success of her undertaking. For she did not know how she had conquered, in fact, although Mr. Preston might not as yet acknowledge it even to himself. Before she was out of hearing, she heard Mr. Sheepshanks say,--\"Sorry to have disturbed your tÉte-ł-tÉte, Preston,\" but though she heard the words, their implied sense did not sink into her mind; she was only feeling how she had gone out glorious and confident, and was coming back to Cynthia defeated.\n","------\n","Molly encounters Mr. Sheepshanks while speaking with Mr. Preston. Mr. Sheepshanks comments on the weather and interrupts their conversation. Molly feels disappointed and defeated as she returns home.\n","------\n","\n","\n","614\n","\"Well, Molly? Oh! I see you haven't got them. After all, I never expected it.\" She sate down, as if she could get over her disappointment better in that position, and Molly stood like a guilty person before her.\"I am so sorry; I did all I could; we were interrupted at last--Mr. Sheepshanks rode up.\"\"Provoking old man! Do you think you should have persuaded him to give up the letters if you had had more time?\"\"I don't know. I wish Mr. Sheepshanks hadn't come up just then. I didn't like his finding me standing talking to Mr. Preston.\"\"Oh! I daresay he'd never think anything about it. What did he--Mr. Preston--say?\"\"He seemed to think you were fully engaged to him, and that these letters were the only proof he had. I think he loves you in his way.\"\"His way, indeed!\" said Cynthia, scornfully.\"The more I think of it, the more I see it would be better for papa to speak to him. I did say I would tell it all to Lady Harriet, and get Lord Cumnor to make him give up the letters. But it would be very awkward.\"\n","------\n","Molly apologizes for not having the letters that were expected, explaining that they were interrupted by Mr. Sheepshanks. Cynthia expresses her disappointment and wonders if Molly could have convinced Mr. Sheepshanks to give up the letters if they had more time. Molly admits that she doesn't know and wishes Mr. Sheepshanks hadn't arrived when he did. Cynthia dismisses Mr. Preston's feelings for her and suggests that her father should speak to him instead. Molly considers telling Lady Harriet\n","------\n","\n","\n","615\n","\"But I will do it in a moment, if you like. I meant what I said; only I feel that papa would manage it best of all, and more privately.\"\"I'll tell you what, Molly--you're bound by a promise, you know, and cannot tell Mr. Gibson without breaking your solemn word--but it's just this: I'll leave Hollingford and never come back again, if ever your father hears of this affair; there!\" Cynthia stood up now, and began to fold up Molly's shawl, in her nervous excitement.\"Oh, Cynthia--Roger!\" was all that Molly said.\"Yes, I know! you need not remind me of him. But I'm not going to live in the house with any one who may be always casting up in his mind the things he had heard against me--things--faults, perhaps--which sound so much worse than they really are. I was so happy when I first came here; you all liked me, and admired me, and thought well of me, and now-- Why, Molly, I can see the difference in you already. You carry your thoughts in your face--I have read them there these two days--you've been thinking, 'How Cynthia must have deceived me; keeping up a correspondence all this time--having half-engagements to two men!' You've been more full of that than of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for herself, without any friend to help her and protect her.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is speaking to Molly about a promise she made to keep a secret from Mr. Gibson. Cynthia suggests that she will leave Hollingford and never return if Molly's father finds out about the affair. Cynthia is worried that if her father hears about the affair, it will affect her relationship with Roger and the way others perceive her. She feels that Molly has already started to judge her and thinks that Molly believes she has deceived her. Cynthia explains that she has always had to take care of herself\n","------\n","\n","\n","616\n","\"Oh! what a brute I am!\" said Cynthia, kissing them away. \"I see--I know it is the truth, and I deserve it--but I need not reproach you.\"\"You did not reproach me!\" said Molly, trying to smile. \"I have thought something of what you said--but I do love you dearly--dearly, Cynthia--I should have done just the same as you did.\"\"No, you would not. Your grain is different, somehow.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Cynthia is feeling remorseful and kisses away tears. She acknowledges that she deserves the truth and does not blame Molly for it. Molly reassures Cynthia that she loves her and would have done the same thing in her position. However, Cynthia believes that Molly's character is different from hers.\n","------\n","\n","\n","617\n","XLV.CONFIDENCES.All the rest of that day Molly was depressed and not well. Having anything to conceal was so unusual--almost so unprecedented a circumstance with her that it preyed upon her in every way.It was a nightmare that she could not shake off; she did so wish to forget it all, and yet every little occurrence seemed to remind her of it. The next morning's post brought several letters; one from Roger for Cynthia, and Molly, letterless herself, looked at Cynthia as she read it, with wistful sadness. It appeared to Molly as though Cynthia should have no satisfaction in these letters, until she had told him what was her exact position with Mr. Preston; yet Cynthia was colouring and dimpling up as she always did at any pretty words of praise, or admiration, or love. But Molly's thoughts and Cynthia's reading were both interrupted by a little triumphant sound from Mrs. Gibson, as she pushed a letter she had just received to her husband, with a--\"There! I must say I expected that!\" Then, turning to Cynthia, she explained--\"It is a letter from uncle Kirkpatrick, love. So kind, wishing you to go and stay with them, and help them to cheer up Helen; poor Helen! I am afraid she is very far from well. But we could not have had her here, without disturbing dear papa in his consulting-room; and, though I could have relinquished my dressing-room--he--well! so I said in my letter how you were grieved--you above all of us, because you are such a friend of Helen's, you know--and how you longed to be of use,--as I am sure you do--and so now they want you to go up directly, for Helen has quite set her heart upon it.\"\n","------\n","Molly is feeling depressed and unwell after a recent event that she is trying to forget. She watches as Cynthia receives a letter from Roger and feels sad that she doesn't have any letters herself. Mrs. Gibson then receives a letter from Uncle Kirkpatrick, inviting Cynthia to go stay with them and help cheer up Helen, who is not feeling well.\n","------\n","\n","\n","618\n","\"Can you be ready to go by the 'Bang-up' to-night?\" said Mr. Gibson; \"for, curiously enough, after more than twenty years of quiet practice at Hollingford, I am summoned up to-day for the first time to a consultation in London to-morrow. I'm afraid Lady Cumnor is worse, my dear.\"\"You don't say so? Poor dear lady! What a shock it is to me! I'm so glad I've had some breakfast. I could not have eaten anything.\"\"Nay, I only say she is worse. With her complaint, being worse may be only a preliminary to being better. Don't take my words for more than their literal meaning.\"\"Thank you. How kind and reassuring dear papa always is! About your gowns, Cynthia?\"\"Oh, they're all right, mamma, thank you. I shall be quite ready by four o'clock. Molly, will you come with me and help me to pack? I wanted to speak to you, dear,\" said she, as soon as they had gone upstairs. \"It is such a relief to get away from a place haunted by that man; but I'm afraid you thought I was glad to leave you; and indeed I am not.\" There was a little flavour of \"protesting too much\" about this; but Molly did not perceive it. She only said, \"Indeed I did not. I know from my own feelings how you must dislike meeting a man in public in a different manner from what you have done in private. I shall try not to see Mr. Preston again for a long, long time, I'm sure. But, Cynthia, you haven't told me one word out of Roger's letter. Please, how is he? Has he quite got over his attack of fever?\"\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson is summoned to a consultation in London because Lady Cumnor is worse. Cynthia is relieved to leave a place haunted by a man and asks Molly about Roger's health.\n","------\n","\n","\n","619\n","Molly took the letter down without a word, and began to copy it at the writing-table; often reading over what she was allowed to read; often pausing, her cheek on her hand, her eyes on the letter, and letting her imagination rove to the writer, and all the scenes in which she had either seen him herself, or in which her fancy had painted him. She was startled from her meditations by Cynthia's sudden entrance into the drawing-room, looking the picture of glowing delight. \"No one here? What a blessing! Ah, Miss Molly, you are more eloquent than you believe yourself. Look here!\" holding up a large full envelope, and then quickly replacing it in her pocket, as if she was afraid of being seen. \"What's the matter, sweet one?\" coming up and caressing Molly. \"Is it worrying itself over that letter? Why, don't you see these are my very own horrible letters, that I am going to burn directly, that Mr. Preston has had the grace to send me, thanks to you, little Molly--cuishla ma chree, pulse of my heart,--the letters that have been hanging over my head like somebody's sword for these two years?\"\n","------\n","Molly is copying a letter at a writing-table and occasionally pausing to imagine the writer and the scenes they have been in together. Cynthia enters the room excitedly and shows Molly a large envelope, which she quickly hides in her pocket. Cynthia explains that the envelope contains her own letters that she is going to burn, thanks to Molly's help. These letters have been causing her stress for two years.\n","------\n","\n","\n","620\n","\"Oh, I am so glad!\" said Molly, rousing up a little. \"I never thought he would have sent them. He is better than I believed him. And now it is all over. I am so glad! You quite think he means to give up all claim over you by this, don't you, Cynthia?\"\"He may claim, but I won't be claimed; and he has no proofs now. It is the most charming relief; and I owe it all to you, you precious little lady! Now there's only one thing more to be done; and if you would but do it for me--\" (coaxing and caressing while she asked the question).\"Oh, Cynthia, don't ask me; I cannot do any more. You don't know how sick I go when I think of yesterday, and Mr. Sheepshanks' look.\"\"It is only a very little thing. I won't burden your conscience with telling you how I got my letters, but it is not through a person I can trust with money; and I must force him to take back his twenty-three pounds odd shillings. I have put it together at the rate of five per cent., and it's sealed up. Oh, Molly, I should go off with such a light heart if you would only try to get it safely to him. It's the last thing; there would be no immediate hurry, you know. You might meet him by chance in a shop, in the street, even at a party--and if you only had it with you in your pocket, there would be nothing so easy.\"\n","------\n","Molly is relieved that someone has sent her letters, and believes that this means the person no longer has any claim over her. Cynthia asks Molly to do one more thing for her, which is to return some money to someone. Molly is hesitant and doesn't want to do it, but Cynthia insists that it is a small task and that Molly could easily do it if she had the money with her.\n","------\n","\n","\n","621\n","\"Very well,\" said Cynthia, \"have it your own way. I think my way is the best: for if any of this affair comes out-- But you've done a great deal for me already, and I won't blame you now for declining to do any more!\"\"I do so dislike having these underhand dealings with him,\" pleaded Molly.\"Underhand! just simply giving him a letter from me! If I left a note for Miss Browning, should you dislike giving it to her?\"\"You know that's very different. I could do it openly.\"\"And yet there might be writing in that; and there wouldn't be a line with the money. It would only be the winding-up--the honourable, honest winding-up of an affair which has worried me for years. But do as you like!\"\"Give it me!\" said Molly. \"I will try.\"\"There's a darling! You can but try; and if you can't give it to him in private, without getting yourself into a scrape, why, keep it till I come back again. He shall have it then, whether he will or no!\"Molly looked forward to her two days alone with Mrs. Gibson with very different anticipations from those with which she had welcomed the similar intercourse with her father. In the first place, there was no accompanying the travellers to the inn from which the coach started; leave-taking in the market-place was quite out of the bounds of Mrs. Gibson's sense of propriety. Besides this, it was a gloomy, rainy evening, and candles had to be brought in at an unusually early hour. There would be no break for six hours--no music, no reading; but the two ladies would sit at their worsted work, pattering away at small-talk, with not even the usual break of dinner; for, to suit the requirements of those who were leaving, they had already dined early. But Mrs. Gibson really meant to make Molly happy, and tried to be an agreeable companion, only Molly was not well, and was uneasy about many apprehended cares and troubles--and at such hours of indisposition as she was then passing through, apprehensions take the shape of certainties, lying await in our paths. Molly would have given a good deal to have shaken off all these feelings, unusual enough to her; but the very house and furniture, and rain-blurred outer landscape, seemed steeped with unpleasant associations, most of them dating from the last few days.\n","------\n","Cynthia and Molly are discussing a plan involving a letter and money that Cynthia wants Molly to deliver to someone. Molly is hesitant about the plan, but Cynthia convinces her to try. Molly is not looking forward to spending two days alone with Mrs. Gibson, as she is feeling unwell and anxious about various troubles. The atmosphere in the house and the recent events have made Molly uncomfortable.\n","------\n","\n","\n","622\n","\"Yes,\" said Molly, rather drearily, having something of the \"toujours perdrix\" feeling at the moment. If she could but have gone away with her father, just for two days, how pleasant it would have been.\"To be sure, love, it would be very nice for you and me to go a little journey all by ourselves. You and I. No one else. If it were not such miserable weather we would have gone off on a little impromptu tour. I've been longing for something of the kind for some weeks; but we live such a restricted kind of life here! I declare sometimes I get quite sick of the very sight of the chairs and tables that I know so well. And one misses the others too! It seems so flat and deserted without them!\"\"Yes! We are very forlorn to-night; but I think it's partly owing to the weather!\"\"Nonsense, dear. I can't have you giving in to the silly fancy of being affected by weather. Poor dear Mr. Kirkpatrick used to say, 'a cheerful heart makes its own sunshine.' He would say it to me, in his pretty way, whenever I was a little low--for I am a complete barometer--you may really judge of the state of the weather by my spirits, I have always been such a sensitive creature! It is well for Cynthia that she does not inherit it; I don't think her easily affected in any way, do you?\"\n","------\n","Molly is feeling dreary and wishes she could go on a trip with her father. She expresses her desire for a change of scenery and mentions feeling bored and lonely without the company of others. Molly's mother dismisses the idea of being affected by the weather and reminisces about Mr. Kirkpatrick, who used to cheer her up when she was feeling low. Molly's mother also mentions that Cynthia, Molly's sister, is not easily affected by things.\n","------\n","\n","\n","623\n","\"Many girls, for instance, would have been touched by the admiration she excited--I may say the attentions she received when she was at her uncle's last summer.\"\"At Mr. Kirkpatrick's?\"\"Yes. There was Mr. Henderson, that young lawyer; that's to say, he is studying law, but he has a good private fortune and is likely to have more, so he can only be what I call playing at law. Mr. Henderson was over head and ears in love with her. It is not my fancy, although I grant mothers are partial: both Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick noticed it; and in one of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's letters, she said that poor Mr. Henderson was going into Switzerland for the long vacation, doubtless to try and forget Cynthia; but she really believed he would find it only 'dragging at each remove a lengthening chain.' I thought it such a refined quotation, and altogether worded so prettily. You must know aunt Kirkpatrick some day, Molly, my love; she is what I call a woman of a truly elegant mind.\"\"I can't help thinking it was a pity that Cynthia did not tell them of her engagement.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph discusses the admiration and attention that a girl named Cynthia received from a young lawyer named Mr. Henderson when she visited her uncle's house. It is mentioned that Mr. Henderson was in love with Cynthia, and both Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick noticed it. The narrator also mentions that Cynthia did not inform them about her engagement, which is seen as a pity.\n","------\n","\n","\n","624\n","\"But what am I to call it?\"\"I don't see why you need to call it anything. Indeed, I don't understand what you mean by 'it.' You should always try to express yourself intelligibly. It really is one of the first principles of the English language. In fact, philosophers might ask what is language given us for at all, if it is not that we may make our meaning understood?\"\"But there is something between Cynthia and Roger; they are more to each other than I am to Osborne, for instance. What am I to call it?\"\"You should not couple your name with that of any unmarried young man; it is so difficult to teach you delicacy, child. Perhaps one may say there is a peculiar relation between dear Cynthia and Roger, but it is very difficult to characterize it; I have no doubt that is the reason she shrinks from speaking about it. For, between ourselves, Molly, I really sometimes think it will come to nothing. He is so long away, and, privately speaking, Cynthia is not very, very constant. I once knew her very much taken before--that little affair is quite gone by; and she was very civil to Mr. Henderson, in her way; I fancy she inherits it, for when I was a girl I was beset by lovers, and could never find in my heart to shake them off. You have not heard dear papa say anything of the old Squire, or dear Osborne, have you? It seems so long since we have heard or seen anything of Osborne. But he must be quite well, I think, or we should have heard of it.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph does not have a clear plot. It consists of a conversation between two characters discussing the difficulty of labeling a relationship between Cynthia and Roger. They also mention the lack of communication from other characters, such as Osborne and the old Squire.\n","------\n","\n","\n","625\n","\"Indeed! I am truly glad to hear it. I always was fond of Osborne; and, do you know, I never really took to Roger? I respected him and all that, of course; but to compare him with Mr. Henderson! Mr. Henderson is so handsome and well-bred, and gets all his gloves from Houbigant!\"It was true that they had not seen anything of Osborne Hamley for a long time; but, as it often happens, just after they had been speaking about him he appeared. It was on the day following Mr. Gibson's departure that Mrs. Gibson received one of the notes, not so common now as formerly, from the family in town, asking her to go over to the Towers, and find a book, or a manuscript, or something or other that Lady Cumnor wanted with all an invalid's impatience. It was just the kind of employment she required for an amusement on a gloomy day, and it put her into a good humour immediately. There was a certain confidential importance about it, and it was a variety, and it gave her the pleasant drive in a fly up the noble avenue, and the sense of being the temporary mistress of all the grand rooms once so familiar to her. She asked Molly to accompany her, out of an access of kindness, but was not at all sorry when Molly excused herself and preferred stopping at home. At eleven o'clock Mrs. Gibson was off, all in her Sunday best (to use the servant's expression, which she herself would so have contemned), well-dressed in order to impose on the servants at the Towers, for there was no one else to see or to be seen by.\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson receives a note from the family in town asking her to go to the Towers and find something for Lady Cumnor. She is excited about the task and sees it as an opportunity to feel important and have a pleasant drive. She asks Molly to come with her, but is secretly relieved when Molly declines. Mrs. Gibson dresses up to impress the servants at the Towers.\n","------\n","\n","\n","626\n","Molly enjoyed the house to herself fully as much as Mrs. Gibson would enjoy having the Towers to herself. She ventured on having her lunch brought upon a tray into the drawing-room, so that she might eat her sandwiches while she went on with her book. In the middle, Mr. Osborne Hamley was announced. He came in, looking wretchedly ill in spite of purblind Mrs. Goodenough's report of his healthy appearance.\"This call is not on you, Molly,\" said he, after the first greetings were over. \"I was in hopes I might have found your father at home; I thought lunch-time was the best hour.\" He had sate down, as if thoroughly glad of the rest, and fallen into a languid stooping position, as if it had become so natural to him that no sense of what were considered good manners sufficed to restrain him now.\"I hope you did not want to see him professionally?\" said Molly, wondering if she was wise in alluding to his health, yet urged to it by her real anxiety.\"Yes, I did. I suppose I may help myself to a biscuit and a glass of wine? No, don't ring for more. I could not eat it if it was here. But I just want a mouthful; this is quite enough, thank you. When will your father be back?\"\n","------\n","Molly is enjoying having the house to herself and decides to have her lunch brought to her in the drawing-room. While she is eating, Mr. Osborne Hamley arrives and appears to be very ill. He explains that he was hoping to see Molly's father, but since he is not home, he decides to rest and have a small snack.

He always is severe on fanciful patients, isn't he, Molly?\"Molly thought that if he saw Osborne's looks just then he would hardly think him fanciful, or be inclined to be severe. But she only said,--\"Papa enjoys a joke at everything, you know. It is a relief after all the sorrow he sees.\"\"Very true. There is a great deal of sorrow in the world. I don't think it's a very happy place after all. So Cynthia is gone to London?\" he added, after a pause. \"I think I should like to have seen her again. Poor old Roger! He loves her very dearly, Molly,\" he said. Molly hardly knew how to answer him in all this; she was so struck by the change in both voice and manner.\"Mamma has gone to the Towers,\" she began, at length. \"Lady Cumnor wanted several things that mamma only can find. She will be sorry to miss you. We were speaking of you only yesterday, and she said how long it was since we had seen you.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, the speaker is expressing their desire to wait until they are better before seeing someone's father. They mention that the father is often severe on fanciful patients but they don't mind if he laughs at them.

Then, as if he had taken a sudden resolution, he spoke again. \"You see, there are others depending upon me--upon my health. You haven't forgotten what you heard that day in the library at home? No, I know you haven't. I have seen the thought of it in your eyes often since then. I didn't know you at that time.

As he left, his eyes met Molly's with a strange look of yearning farewell that struck her at the time, and that she remembered strongly afterwards. \"Such a nice suitable thing, and I came in the midst, and spoilt it all. I am sure you're very kind, my dear, considering--\"\"Considering what, my dear Miss Phoebe? If you are conjecturing a love affair between Mr. Osborne Hamley and me, you never were more mistaken in your life. I think I told you so once before. Please do believe me.\"\"Oh, yes! I remember. And somehow sister got it into her head it was Mr. Preston. I recollect.\"\"One guess is just as wrong as the other,\" said Molly, smiling, and trying to look perfectly indifferent, but going extremely red at the mention of Mr. Preston's name. It was very difficult for her to keep up any conversation, for her heart was full of Osborne--his changed appearance, his melancholy words of foreboding, and his confidences about his wife--French, Catholic, servant. Molly could not help trying to piece these strange facts together by imaginations of her own, and found it very hard work to attend to kind Miss Phoebe's unceasing patter. She came up to the point, however, when the voice ceased; and could recall, in a mechanical manner, the echo of the last words, which both from Miss Phoebe's look, and the dying accent that lingered in Molly's ear, she perceived to be a question. Miss Phoebe was asking her if she would go out with her. She was going to Grinstead's, the bookseller of Hollingford; who, in addition to his regular business, was the agent for the Hollingford Book Society, received their subscriptions, kept their accounts, ordered their books from London, and, on payment of a small salary, allowed the Society to keep their volumes on shelves in his shop. It was the centre of news, and the club, as it were, of the little town. Everybody who pretended to gentility in the place belonged to it. It was a test of gentility, indeed, rather than of education or a love of literature. No shopkeeper would have thought of offering himself as a member, however great his general intelligence and love of reading; while it boasted on its list of subscribers most of the county families in the neighbourhood, some of whom subscribed to it as a sort of duty belonging to their station, without often using their privilege of reading the books: while there were residents in the little town, such as Mrs. Goodenough, who privately thought reading a great waste of time, that might be much better employed in sewing, and knitting, and pastry-making, but who nevertheless belonged to it as a mark of station, just as these good, motherly women would have thought it a terrible come-down in the world if they had not had a pretty young servant-maid to fetch them home from the tea-parties at night. At any rate, Grinstead's was a very convenient place for a lounge. In that view of the Book Society every one agreed.\n","------\n","Miss Phoebe apologizes for interrupting Osborne and Molly, but Osborne leaves before she finishes.

So, although Molly knew full well, and her stepmother knew full well, and Maria knew full well, that neither Mrs. Gibson nor Molly touched dessert, it was set on the table with as much form as if Cynthia had been at home, who delighted in almonds and raisins; or Mr. Gibson been there, who never could resist dates, though he always protested against \"persons in their station of life having a formal dessert set out before them every day.\"And Mrs. Gibson herself apologized, as it were, to Molly to-day, in the same words she had often used to Mr. Gibson,--\"It's no extravagance, for we need not eat it--I never do.

Its nature is the reverse of that of the dormouse.

And neither of 'em ever repented 'em of their confidence. You may take my word for it, beans and bacon will taste better (and Mr. Ashton's Nancy in her own house) than all the sweetbreads and spring chickens she's been a-doing for him this seventeen years. But if I chose, I could tell you of something as would interest you all a deal more than old Nancy's marriage to a widower with nine children--only as the young folks themselves is meeting in private, clandestine-like, it's perhaps not for me to tell their secrets.\"\n","------\n","Miss Browning is playing cards with Mrs. Dawes while eating pound cake. Mrs. Goodenough defends marriage and mentions that she would have given advice to Nancy if she had seen her. Miss Browning argues that she can make dinner decisions without interference, and Mrs. Goodenough claims that her husbands were pleased with her cooking. Mrs. Goodenough suggests that beans and bacon will taste better than fancy dishes, and hints at a secret involving young people meeting in secret.\n","------\n","\n","\n","635\n","\"It's not the out-speaking, it's what you say that goes against me, Miss Browning,\" said Mrs. Goodenough, affronted, yet ready to play her card as soon as needed.

She said suddenly and abruptly,--\"I don't know what I have done that any man should make me his slave.\" If she was referring to any prospect of matrimonial danger she saw opening before her fancy, she might have been comforted.

It's odd if you will. I was odd myself as a girl; I never could abide a plate of gathered gooseberries, but I must needs go and skulk behind a bush and gather 'em for myself.

He had hardly time to speak to his family, he had so immediately to rush off to pressing cases of illness. But Molly managed to arrest him in the hall, standing there with his great coat held out ready for him to put on, but whispering as she did so--\"Papa! Mr. Osborne Hamley was here to see you yesterday. He looks very ill, and he's evidently frightened about himself.\"Mr. Gibson faced about, and looked at her for a moment; but all he said was--\"I'll go and see him; don't tell your mother where I'm gone: you've not mentioned this to her, I hope?\"\"No,\" said Molly, for she had only told Mrs. Gibson of Osborne's call, not of the occasion for it.\"Don't say anything about it; there's no need. Now I think of it, I can't possibly go to-day,--but I will go.\"\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson returns home to find a lot of work waiting for him. Molly informs him that Mr. Osborne Hamley visited and is looking ill and scared. Mr. Gibson decides to go see him, but asks Molly not to tell her mother. However, he realizes he cannot go that day but promises to go later.\n","------\n","\n","\n","640\n","\"Helen cannot be so very ill,\" said Molly at length, \"or Cynthia would not want her pink muslin and daisy wreath.\"\"I don't see that that follows, I'm sure,\" replied Mrs. Gibson rather sharply. \"Helen would never be so selfish as to tie Cynthia to her side, however ill she was. Indeed, I should not have felt that it was my duty to let Cynthia go to London at all, if I had thought she was to be perpetually exposed to the depressing atmosphere of a sick-room. Besides, it must be so good for Helen to have Cynthia coming in with bright pleasant accounts of the parties she has been to--even if Cynthia disliked gaiety I should desire her to sacrifice herself and go out as much as she could, for Helen's sake. My idea of nursing is that one should not be always thinking of one's own feelings and wishes, but doing those things which will most serve to beguile the weary hours of an invalid. But then so few people have had to consider the subject so deeply as I have done!\"Mrs. Gibson here thought fit to sigh before going on with Cynthia's letter. As far as Molly could make any sense out of this rather incoherent epistle, very incoherently read aloud to her, Cynthia was really pleased, and glad to be of use and comfort to Helen, but at the same time very ready to be easily persuaded into the perpetual small gaieties which abounded in her uncle's house in London, even at this dead season of the year. Mrs. Gibson came upon Mr. Henderson's name once, and then went on with a running \"um-um-um\" to herself, which sounded very mysterious, but which might as well have been omitted, as all that Cynthia really said about him was, \"Mr. Henderson's mother has advised my aunt to consult a certain Dr. Donaldson, who is said to be very clever in such cases as Helen's, but my uncle is not sufficiently sure of the professional etiquette, &c.\" Then there came a very affectionate, carefully worded message to Molly,--implying a good deal more than was said of loving gratitude for the trouble she had taken on Cynthia's behalf. And that was all; and Molly went away a little depressed; she knew not why.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Molly is discussing with Mrs. Gibson the illness of Helen. Molly believes that Helen cannot be very ill because Cynthia, Helen's sister, wants her pink muslin and daisy wreath.

Mrs. Gibson also believes that it is good for Helen to have Cynthia come in with bright accounts of parties she has been to.

The simple innocent girl, who walked through the quiet streets without a thought of being the object of mysterious implications, became for a time the unconscious black sheep of the town. Servants heard part of what was said in their mistresses' drawing-rooms, and exaggerated the sayings amongst themselves with the coarse strengthening of expression common with uneducated people. Mr. Preston himself became aware that her name was being coupled with his, though hardly to the extent to which the love of excitement and gossip had carried people's speeches; he chuckled over the mistake, but took no pains to correct it. \"It serves her right,\" said he to himself, \"for meddling with other folk's business,\" and he felt himself avenged for the discomfiture which her menace of appealing to Lady Harriet had caused him, and the mortification he had experienced in learning from her plain-speaking lips, how he had been talked over by Cynthia and herself, with personal dislike on the one side, and evident contempt on the other. Besides, if any denial of Mr. Preston's stirred up an examination as to the real truth, more might come out of his baffled endeavours to compel Cynthia to keep to her engagement to him than he cared to have known. He was angry with himself for still loving Cynthia; loving her in his own fashion, be it understood. He told himself that many a woman of more position and wealth would be glad enough to have him; some of them pretty women too. And he asked himself why he was such a confounded fool as to go on hankering after a penniless girl, who was as fickle as the wind? The answer was silly enough, logically; but forcible in fact. Cynthia was Cynthia, and not Venus herself could have been her substitute. In this one thing Mr. Preston was more really true than many worthy men; who, seeking to be married, turn with careless facility from the unattainable to the attainable, and keep their feelings and fancy tolerably loose till they find a woman who consents to be their wife. But no one would ever be to Mr. Preston what Cynthia had been, and was; and yet he could have stabbed her in certain of his moods. So, Molly, who had come between him and the object of his desire, was not likely to find favour in his sight, or to obtain friendly actions from him.\n","------\n","The plot of this paragraph revolves around Molly's secret meetings with Mr. Preston, which have sparked gossip and scandal in the town.

Mrs. Goodenough openly pulled her grand-daughter away, when the young girl stopped to speak to Molly in the street, and an engagement which the two had made for a long walk together was cut very short by a very trumpery excuse. Mrs. Goodenough explained her conduct in the following manner to some of her friends:--\"You see, I don't think the worse of a girl for meeting her sweetheart here and there and everywhere, till she gets talked about; but then when she does--and Molly Gibson's name is in everybody's mouth--I think it's only fair to Bessy, who has trusted me with Annabella--not to let her daughter be seen with a lass who has managed her matters so badly as to set folk talking about her. My maxim is this,--and it's a very good working one, you may depend on't--women should mind what they're about, and never be talked of; and if a woman's talked of, the less her friends have to do with her till the talk has died away, the better. So Annabella is not to have anything to do with Molly Gibson, this visit at any rate.\"\n","------\n","Molly Gibson begins to feel ostracized by people in her community. Mrs. Goodenough, a friend of Molly's, starts avoiding her and discourages her granddaughter from interacting with Molly.

I ought not to have spoken as I did; but that's nothing to this affair, you see.\"\"I hope you do me the justice to perceive that I only repeated what I had heard on good authority, Miss Browning,\" said Mrs. Dawes in reply.\"My dear, don't repeat evil on any authority unless you can do some good by speaking about it,\" said Miss Browning, laying her hand on Mrs. Dawes' shoulder. \"I'm not a good woman, but I know what is good, and that advice is. And now I think I can tell you that I beg your pardon for flying out upon you so; but God knows what pain you were putting me to. You'll forgive me, won't you, my dear?\" Mrs. Dawes felt the hand trembling on her shoulder, and saw the real distress of Miss Browning's mind, so it was not difficult for her to grant the requested forgiveness. Then Miss Browning went home, and said but a few words to Phoebe, who indeed saw well enough that her sister had heard the reports confirmed, and needed no further explanation of the cause of scarcely-tasted dinner, and short replies, and saddened looks. Presently Miss Browning sate down and wrote a short note. Then she rang the bell, and told the little maiden who answered it to take it to Mr. Gibson, and if he was out to see that it was given to him as soon as ever he came home. And then she went and put on her Sunday cap; and Miss Phoebe knew that her sister had written to ask Mr. Gibson to come and be told of the rumours affecting his daughter. Miss Browning was sadly disturbed at the information she had received, and the task that lay before her; she was miserably uncomfortable to herself and irritable to Miss Phoebe, and the netting-cotton she was using kept continually snapping and breaking from the jerks of her nervous hands. When the knock at the door was heard,--the well-known doctor's knock,--Miss Browning took off her spectacles, and dropped them on the carpet, breaking them as she did so; and then she bade Miss Phoebe leave the room, as if her presence had cast the evil-eye, and caused the misfortune. She wanted to look natural, and was distressed at forgetting whether she usually received him sitting or standing.\n","------\n","Miss Browning is upset after hearing rumors about someone, possibly Mrs. Dawes, and apologizes for her previous comments.

It's out now, and God help us both, and the poor child too, for I'm sure she's been led astray, and not gone wrong by her own free will!\"\"Molly!\" said he, fighting against her words. \"What's my little Molly been doing or saying?\"\"Oh!

He kept out of the way of hearing gossip; but she was perpetually thrown into the small society of the place. Mrs. Gibson herself had caught cold, and moreover was not tempted by the quiet old-fashioned visiting which was going on just about this time, provoked by the visit of two of Mrs. Dawes' pretty unrefined nieces, who laughed, and chattered, and ate, and would fain have flirted with Mr. Ashton, the vicar, could he have been brought by any possibility to understand his share in the business. Mr. Preston did not accept the invitations to Hollingford tea-drinkings with the same eager gratitude as he had done a year before: or else the shadow which hung over Molly would have extended to him, her co-partner in the clandestine meetings which gave such umbrage to the feminine virtue of the town. Molly herself was invited, because it would not do to pass any apparent slight on either Mr. or Mrs. Gibson; but there was a tacit and underhand protest against her being received on the old terms. Every one was civil to her, but no one was cordial; there was a very perceptible film of difference in their behaviour to her from what it was formerly; nothing that had outlines and could be defined.

Molly tried to be thankful that her father was not in the mood for visiting. She was even glad that her stepmother was too much of an invalid to come out, when she felt thus slighted, and as it were, degraded from her place.

I have always been a kind of pet with gentlemen, and poor Mr. Kirkpatrick never knew how to make enough of me.

There was every probability that \"the family\" would make a longer residence at the Towers than they had done for several years, during which time they had been wanderers hither and thither in search of health. Somehow, after all, it was very pleasant and restful to come to the old ancestral home, and every member of the family enjoyed it in his or her own way; Lord Cumnor most especially. His talent for gossip and his love of small details had scarcely fair play in the hurry of a London life, and were much nipped in the bud during his Continental sojournings, as he neither spoke French fluently, nor understood it easily when spoken. Besides, he was a great proprietor, and liked to know how his land was going on; how his tenants were faring in the world. He liked to hear of their births, marriages, and deaths, and had something of a royal memory for faces. In short, if ever a peer was an old woman, Lord Cumnor was that peer; but he was a very good-natured old woman, and rode about on his stout old cob with his pockets full of halfpence for the children, and little packets of snuff for the old people. Like an old woman, too, he enjoyed an afternoon cup of tea in his wife's sitting-room, and over his gossip's beverage he would repeat all that he had learnt in the day. Lady Cumnor was exactly in that state of convalescence when such talk as her lord's was extremely agreeable to her, but she had contemned the habit of listening to gossip so severely all her life, that she thought it due to consistency to listen first, and enter a supercilious protest afterwards. It had, however, come to be a family habit for all of them to gather together in Lady Cumnor's room on their return from their daily walks, or drives, or rides, and over the fire, sipping their tea at her early meal, to recount the morsels of local intelligence they had heard during the morning. When they had said all that they had to say (and not before), they had always to listen to a short homily from her ladyship on the well-worn texts,--the poorness of conversation about persons,--the probable falsehood of all they had heard, and the degradation of character implied by its repetition. On one of these November evenings they were all assembled in Lady Cumnor's room. She was lying,--all draped in white, and covered up with an Indian shawl,--on a sofa near the fire. Lady Harriet sate on the rug, close before the wood-fire, picking up fallen embers with a pair of dwarf tongs, and piling them on the red and odorous heap in the centre of the hearth. Lady Cuxhaven, notable from girlhood, was using the blind man's holiday to net fruit-nets for the walls at Cuxhaven Park. Lady Cumnor's woman was trying to see to pour out tea by the light of one small wax-candle in the background (for Lady Cumnor could not bear much light to her weakened eyes); and the great leafless branches of the trees outside the house kept sweeping against the windows, moved by the wind that was gathering.\n","------\n","Lady Cumnor has recovered from her illness and has been brought to the Towers for a change of air. The family plans to stay at the Towers for a longer period of time than they have in the past. Lord Cumnor enjoys being at the ancestral home and likes to gossip and hear about the well-being of his tenants. The family gathers in Lady Cumnor's room to share local gossip, although Lady Cumnor disapproves of gossip and gives a lecture on the subject.\n","------\n","\n","\n","666\n","\"I beg your pardon, my lady,--I'm later than I should have been, I know. Why! haven't you had your tea yet?\" he exclaimed, bustling about to get the cup for his wife.\"You know I never take cream before I've sweetened it,\" said she, with even more emphasis on the \"never\" than usual.\"Oh, dear! What a simpleton I am! I think I might have remembered it by this time. You see I met old Sheepshanks, and that's the reason of it.\"\"Of your handing me the cream before the sugar?\" asked his wife. It was one of her grim jokes.\"No, no! ha, ha! You're better this evening, I think, my dear. But, as I was saying, Sheepshanks is such an eternal talker, there's no getting away from him, and I had no idea it was so late!\"\"Well, I think the least you can do is to tell us something of Mr. Sheepshanks' conversation now you have torn yourself away from him.\"\"Conversation! did I call it conversation? I don't think I said much. I listened. He really has always a great deal to say. More than Preston, for instance. And, by the way, he was telling me something about Preston;--old Sheepshanks thinks he'll be married before long,--he says there's a great deal of gossip going on about him and Gibson's daughter. They've been caught meeting in the park, and corresponding, and all that kind of thing that is likely to end in a marriage.\"\n","------\n","The husband arrives home late and apologizes to his wife for not having her tea ready. He explains that he met an old acquaintance named Sheepshanks who is a talkative person, causing him to lose track of time. The wife jokingly asks if his forgetfulness is the reason he handed her the cream before the sugar. The husband laughs and mentions that Sheepshanks was talking about their mutual friend Preston, who is rumored to be getting married to Gibson's daughter.\n","------\n","\n","\n","667\n","\"I daresay it's not true,\" said Lady Cumnor, in a very audible aside to Lady Harriet. \"Papa picks up stories one day to contradict them the next.\"\"Ah, but this did sound like truth. Sheepshanks said all the old ladies in the town had got hold of it, and were making a great scandal out of it.\"\"I don't think it does sound quite a nice story. I wonder what Clare could be doing to allow such goings on,\" said Lady Cuxhaven.\"I think it is much more likely that Clare's own daughter--that pretty pawky Miss Kirkpatrick--is the real heroine of this story,\" said Lady Harriet. \"She always looks like a heroine of genteel comedy; and those young ladies were capable of a good deal of innocent intriguing, if I remember rightly. Now little Molly Gibson has a certain _gaucherie_ about her which would disqualify her at once from any clandestine proceedings. Besides, 'clandestine!' why, the child is truth itself. Papa, are you sure Mr. Sheepshanks said it was Miss Gibson that was exciting Hollingford scandal? Wasn't it Miss Kirkpatrick? The notion of her and Mr. Preston making a match of it doesn't sound so incongruous; but if it's my little friend Molly, I'll go to church and forbid the banns.\"\n","------\n","There is a scandalous story circulating in town, and Lady Cumnor doubts its truthfulness. Lady Harriet mentions that Sheepshanks, a local gossip, claims that all the old ladies in town are talking about it. Lady Cuxhaven wonders what Clare, possibly referring to someone named Clare, could be doing to allow such scandalous behavior. Lady Harriet suggests that Clare's daughter, Miss Kirkpatrick, is the real heroine of the story, as she always looks like a character from\n","------\n","\n","\n","668\n","\"Mamma, it's only tit for tat. They take the most lively interest in all our sayings and doings. If I were going to be married, they would want to know every possible particular,--when we first met, what we first said to each other, what I wore, and whether he offered by letter or in person. I'm sure those good Miss Brownings were wonderfully well-informed as to Mary's methods of managing her nursery, and educating her girls; so it's only a proper return of the compliment to want to know on our side how they are going on. I'm quite of papa's faction. I like to hear all the local gossip.\"\"Especially when it is flavoured with a spice of scandal and impropriety, as in this case,\" said Lady Cumnor, with the momentary bitterness of a convalescent invalid. Lady Harriet coloured with annoyance. But then she rallied her courage, and said with more gravity than before,--\"I am really interested in this story about Molly Gibson, I own. I both like and respect her; and I do not like to hear her name coupled with that of Mr. Preston. I can't help fancying papa has made some mistake.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph is a conversation between two characters, Mamma and Lady Cumnor, discussing their interest in the personal lives of others. Mamma explains that they are curious about the details of people's relationships and marriages, just as others are curious about their own lives. Lady Cumnor expresses her disapproval of gossip and scandal, particularly in relation to Molly Gibson and Mr. Preston. Lady Harriet defends Molly and questions her father's judgment.\n","------\n","\n","\n","669\n","\"I warned her against him the day of her father's wedding. And what a straightforward, out-spoken topic it was then! I don't believe it; it's only one of old Sheepshanks' stories, half invention and half deafness.\"The next day Lady Harriet rode over to Hollingford, and for the settling of her curiosity she called on Miss Brownings, and introduced the subject. She would not have spoken about the rumour she had heard to any who were not warm friends of Molly's. If Mr. Sheepshanks had chosen to allude to it when she had been riding with her father, she would very soon have silenced him by one of the haughty looks she knew full well how to assume. But she felt as if she must know the truth, and accordingly she began thus abruptly to Miss Browning:\"What is all this I hear about my little friend Molly Gibson and Mr. Preston?\"\"Oh, Lady Harriet! have you heard of it? We are so sorry!\"\"Sorry for what?\"\"I think, begging your ladyship's pardon, we had better not say any more till we know how much you know,\" said Miss Browning.\n","------\n","Lady Harriet warns someone about a man on the day of her father's wedding. The next day, Lady Harriet goes to Hollingford and asks Miss Brownings about a rumor she heard about Molly Gibson and Mr. Preston. Miss Browning is sorry and suggests they wait to discuss further until they know how much Lady Harriet knows.\n","------\n","\n","\n","670\n","\"I'm afraid it's no laughing matter for poor Molly,\" said Miss Browning, shaking her head. \"People do say such things!\"\"But I don't believe them; indeed I don't,\" burst in Miss Phoebe, half crying.\"No more will I, then,\" said Lady Harriet, taking the good lady's hand.\"It's all very fine, Phoebe, saying you don't believe them, but I should like to know who it was that convinced me, sadly against my will, I am sure.\"\"I only told you the facts as Mrs. Goodenough told them me, sister; but I'm sure if you had seen poor patient Molly as I have done, sitting up in a corner of a room, looking at the _Beauties of England and Wales_ till she must have been sick of them, and no one speaking to her; and she as gentle and sweet as ever at the end of the evening, though maybe a bit pale--facts or no facts, I won't believe anything against her.\"So there sate Miss Phoebe, in tearful defiance of facts.\"And, as I said before, I'm quite of your opinion,\" said Lady Harriet.\"But how does your ladyship explain away her meetings with Mr. Preston in all sorts of unlikely and open-air places?\" asked Miss Browning,--who, to do her justice, would have been only too glad to join Molly's partisans, if she could have preserved her character for logical deduction at the same time. \"I went so far as to send for her father and tell him all about it. I thought at least he would have horsewhipped Mr. Preston; but he seems to have taken no notice of it.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph discusses a rumor about a woman named Molly and her alleged meetings with a man named Mr. Preston. Miss Phoebe and Lady Harriet express their disbelief in the rumors, while Miss Browning questions Molly's actions and informs her father about the situation.\n","------\n","\n","\n","671\n","\"Mr. Gibson knew of none when I thought it my duty to speak to him,\" said Miss Browning.\"Why, suppose that Mr. Preston is engaged to Miss Kirkpatrick, and Molly is confidante and messenger?\"\"I don't see that your ladyship's supposition much alters the blame. Why, if he is honourably engaged to Cynthia Kirkpatrick, does he not visit her openly at her home in Mr. Gibson's house? Why does Molly lend herself to clandestine proceedings?\"\"One can't account for everything,\" said Lady Harriet, a little impatiently, for reason was going hard against her. \"But I choose to have faith in Molly Gibson. I'm sure she's not done anything very wrong. I've a great mind to go and call on her--Mrs. Gibson is confined to her room with this horrid influenza--and take her with me on a round of calls through this little gossiping town,--on Mrs. Goodenough, or Badenough, who seems to have been propagating all these stories. But I've not time to-day. I've to meet papa at three, and it's three now. Only remember, Miss Phoebe, it's you and I against the world, in defence of a distressed damsel.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Lady Harriet and Miss Browning are discussing the rumors surrounding Mr. Preston and Miss Kirkpatrick's engagement. Lady Harriet questions why Mr. Preston does not openly visit Miss Kirkpatrick at her home and why Molly is involved in clandestine proceedings. Miss Browning suggests that Molly may be acting as a confidante and messenger between the couple. Lady Harriet defends Molly, expressing her faith in her and her intention to go and call on her. She also mentions her plans\n","------\n","\n","\n","672\n","\"Now, I don't think that's pretty of you, Phoebe,\" said Miss Browning in some displeasure, as soon as she was alone with her sister. \"First, you convince me against my will, and make me very unhappy; and I have to do unpleasant things, all because you've made me believe that certain statements are true; and then you turn round and cry, and say you don't believe a word of it all, making me out a regular ogre and backbiter. No! it's of no use. I shan't listen to you.\" So she left Miss Phoebe in tears, and locked herself up in her own room.Lady Harriet, meanwhile, was riding homewards by her father's side, apparently listening to all he chose to say, but in reality turning over the probabilities and possibilities that might account for these strange interviews between Molly and Mr. Preston. It was a case of _parler de l'ëne et l'on en voit les oreilles_. At a turn in the road they saw Mr. Preston a little way before them, coming towards them on his good horse, _point device_, in his riding attire.\n","------\n","Miss Browning is upset with her sister, Phoebe, for convincing her to believe certain statements that have made her unhappy. Phoebe then denies believing any of it, causing Miss Browning to feel like an ogre and backbiter. Miss Browning leaves Phoebe in tears and locks herself in her room.

They see Mr. Preston riding\n","------\n","\n","\n","673\n","\"Aha! here's Preston. Good-day to you. I was just wanting to ask you about that slip of pasture-land on the Home Farm. John Brickkill wants to plough it up and crop it. It's not two acres at the best.\"While they were talking over this bit of land, Lady Harriet came to her resolution. As soon as her father had finished, she said,--\"Mr. Preston, perhaps you will allow me to ask you one or two questions to relieve my mind, for I am in some little perplexity at present.\"\"Certainly; I shall only be too happy to give you any information in my power.\" But the moment after he had made this polite speech, he recollected Molly's speech--that she would refer her case to Lady Harriet. But the letters had been returned, and the affair was now wound up. She had come off conqueror, he the vanquished. Surely she would never have been so ungenerous as to appeal after that.\"There are reports about Miss Gibson and you current among the gossips of Hollingford. Are we to congratulate you on your engagement to that young lady?\"\n","------\n","Lady Harriet approaches Mr. Preston to discuss a slip of pasture-land on the Home Farm that John Brickkill wants to plough up. However, Lady Harriet interrupts the conversation to ask Mr. Preston about the rumors circulating about him and Miss Gibson. She wants to know if they are engaged.\n","------\n","\n","\n","674\n","She looked at him with the air of a person expecting an answer, and expecting a truthful answer.\"I am not so fortunate,\" replied he, trying to make his horse appear fidgety, without incurring observation.\"Then I may contradict that report?\" asked Lady Harriet quickly. \"Or is there any reason for believing that in time it may come true? I ask because such reports, if unfounded, do harm to young ladies.\"\"Keep other sweethearts off,\" put in Lord Cumnor, looking a good deal pleased at his own discernment. Lady Harriet went on:--\"And I take a great interest in Miss Gibson.\"Mr. Preston saw from her manner that he was \"in for it,\" as he expressed it to himself. The question was, how much or how little did she know?\"I have no expectation or hope of ever having a nearer interest in Miss Gibson than I have at present. I shall be glad if this straightforward answer relieves your ladyship from your perplexity.\"He could not help the touch of insolence that accompanied these last words. It was not in the words themselves, nor in the tone in which they were spoken, nor in the look which accompanied them, it was in all; it implied a doubt of Lady Harriet's right to question him as she did; and there was something of defiance in it as well. But this touch of insolence put Lady Harriet's mettle up; and she was not one to check herself, in any course, for the opinion of an inferior.\n","------\n","Lady Harriet is questioning Mr. Preston about his relationship with Miss Gibson. Mr. Preston denies having any romantic interest in Miss Gibson and implies that Lady Harriet has no right to question him. Lady Harriet is offended by Mr. Preston's insolence and is determined to continue pursuing the matter.\n","------\n","\n","\n","675\n","\"My dear Harriet, are not you going too far? You don't know--Mr. Preston may have intentions--unacknowledged intentions.\"\"No, my lord. I have no intentions with regard to Miss Gibson. She may be a very worthy young lady--I have no doubt she is. Lady Harriet seems determined to push me into such a position that I cannot but acknowledge myself to be--it is not enviable--not pleasant to own--but I am, in fact, a jilted man; jilted by Miss Kirkpatrick, after a tolerably long engagement. My interviews with Miss Gibson were not of the most agreeable kind--as you may conclude when I tell you she was, I believe, the instigator--certainly, she was the agent in this last step of Miss Kirkpatrick's. Is your ladyship's curiosity\" (with an emphasis on this last word) \"satisfied with this rather mortifying confession of mine?\"\"Harriet, my dear, you've gone too far--we had no right to pry into Mr. Preston's private affairs.\"\"No more I had,\" said Lady Harriet, with a smile of winning frankness: the first smile she had accorded to Mr. Preston for many a long day; ever since the time, years ago, when, presuming on his handsomeness, he had assumed a tone of gallant familiarity with Lady Harriet, and paid her personal compliments as he would have done to an equal.\n","------\n","Lady Harriet is questioning Mr. Preston about his intentions towards Miss Gibson. Mr. Preston denies having any intentions towards Miss Gibson and reveals that he was previously engaged to Miss Kirkpatrick, who ended their engagement with the help of Miss Gibson.

Lady Harriet had to stand a good many strictures on manners, and proper dignity for a few days after this. However, she consoled herself by calling on the Gibsons; and, finding that Mrs. Gibson (who was still an invalid) was asleep at the time, she experienced no difficulty in carrying off the unconscious Molly for a walk, which Lady Harriet so contrived that they twice passed through all the length of the principal street of the town, loitered at Grinstead's for half an hour, and wound up by Lady Harriet's calling on the Miss Brownings, who, to her regret, were not at home.\"Perhaps, it's as well,\" said she, after a minute's consideration. \"I'll leave my card, and put your name down underneath it, Molly.\"\n","------\n","Mr. Preston asks Lady Harriet to keep their conversation confidential. The Earl, however, tells his wife and Lady Cuxhaven about the conversation, also in confidence. Lady Harriet faces criticism for her behavior and manners. She decides to visit the Gibsons and takes Molly for a walk. They pass through the town and visit various places. Lady Harriet then calls on the Miss Brownings, but they are not home. She leaves her card and adds Molly's name to it.\n","------\n","\n","\n","677\n","\"Never mind, little one. To-day you shall do everything properly, and according to full etiquette.\"\"And now tell Mrs. Gibson to come out to the Towers for a long day; we will send the carriage for her whenever she will let us know that she is strong enough to come. Indeed, she had better come for a few days; at this time of the year it doesn't do for an invalid to be out in the evenings, even in a carriage.\" So spoke Lady Harriet, standing on the white door-steps at Miss Brownings', and holding Molly's hand while she wished her good-by. \"You'll tell her, dear, that I came partly to see her--but that finding her asleep, I ran off with you, and don't forget about her coming to stay with us for change of air--mamma will like it, I'm sure--and the carriage, and all that. And now good-by, we've done a good day's work! And better than you're aware of,\" continued she, still addressing Molly, though the latter was quite out of hearing. \"Hollingford is not the place I take it to be, if it doesn't veer round in Miss Gibson's favour after my to-day's trotting of that child about.\"\n","------\n","Lady Harriet is speaking to Molly, telling her that she will do everything properly and according to etiquette.

If Molly had thought her manner of departure was scarcely as affectionate and considerate as it might have been,--if such a thought had crossed Molly's fancy for an instant, she was repentant for it as soon as ever Cynthia returned, and the girls met together face to face, with all the old familiar affection, going upstairs to the drawing-room, with their arms round each other's waists, and sitting there together hand in hand. Cynthia's whole manner was more quiet than it had been, when the weight of her unpleasant secret rested on her mind, and made her alternately despondent or flighty.\"After all,\" said Cynthia, \"there's a look of home about these rooms which is very pleasant. But I wish I could see you looking stronger, mamma! that's the only unpleasant thing. Molly, why didn't you send for me?\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is recovering from influenza and is unable to accept an invitation to the Towers. Meanwhile, Cynthia returns home from London and is warmly welcomed by Molly. Cynthia's demeanor is more calm and she expresses concern for her mother's health. Cynthia wonders why Molly didn't send for her while she was away.\n","------\n","\n","\n","679\n","\"But I wouldn't let her,\" said Mrs. Gibson. \"You were much better in London than here, for you could have done me no good; and your letters were very agreeable to read; and now Helen is better, and I'm nearly well, and you've come home just at the right time, for everybody is full of the Charity Ball.\"\"But we are not going this year, mamma,\" said Cynthia decidedly. \"It's on the 25th, isn't it? and I'm sure you'll never be well enough to take us.\"\"You really seem determined to make me out worse than I am, child,\" said Mrs. Gibson, rather querulously, she being one of those who, when their malady is only trifling, exaggerate it, but when it is really of some consequence, are unwilling to sacrifice any pleasures by acknowledging it. It was well for her in this instance that her husband had wisdom and authority enough to forbid her going to this ball, on which she had set her heart; but the consequence of his prohibition was an increase of domestic plaintiveness and low spirits, which seemed to tell on Cynthia--the bright gay Cynthia herself--and it was often hard work for Molly to keep up the spirits of two other people as well as her own. Ill-health might account for Mrs. Gibson's despondency, but why was Cynthia so silent, not to say so sighing? Molly was puzzled to account for it; and all the more perplexed because from time to time Cynthia kept calling upon her for praise for some unknown and mysterious virtue that she had practised; and Molly was young enough to believe that, after any exercise of virtue, the spirits rose, cheered up by an approving conscience. Such was not the case with Cynthia, however. She sometimes said such things as these, when she had been particularly inert and desponding:--\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is recovering from an illness and her daughter, Cynthia, is taking care of her. Cynthia's sister, Helen, is also recovering from an illness. Mrs. Gibson is excited about the upcoming Charity Ball, but Cynthia and her father decide that they will not be attending. This decision causes Mrs. Gibson to become more despondent and Cynthia to become quiet and sighing. Molly, a friend of the family, is confused by Cynthia's behavior and her constant need for praise for her\n","------\n","\n","\n","680\n","But Molly had had some experience of Cynthia's whim of perpetually hinting at a mystery which she did not mean to reveal in the Mr. Preston days, and, although she was occasionally piqued into curiosity, Cynthia's allusions at something more in the background fell in general on rather deaf ears. One day the mystery burst its shell, and came out in the shape of an offer made to Cynthia by Mr. Henderson--and refused. Under all the circumstances, Molly could not appreciate the heroic goodness so often alluded to. The revelation of the secret at last took place in this way. Mrs. Gibson breakfasted in bed: she had done so ever since she had had the influenza; and, consequently, her own private letters always went up on her breakfast-tray. One morning she came into the drawing-room earlier than usual, with an open letter in her hand.\"I've had a letter from aunt Kirkpatrick, Cynthia. She sends me my dividends,--your uncle is so busy. But what does she mean by this, Cynthia?\" (holding out the letter to her, with a certain paragraph indicated by her finger). Cynthia put her netting on one side, and looked at the writing. Suddenly her face turned scarlet, and then became of a deadly white. She looked at Molly, as if to gain courage from the strong serene countenance.\n","------\n","Molly is familiar with Cynthia's tendency to hint at a mystery without revealing it. Cynthia receives an offer from Mr. Henderson, but refuses it. Molly is not impressed by Cynthia's supposed heroic goodness. One day, Mrs. Gibson receives a letter from Aunt Kirkpatrick, which includes a paragraph that confuses her. Cynthia looks at the letter and her face turns red and then pale. She looks to Molly for support.\n","------\n","\n","\n","681\n","\"Refused him--and you never told me, but let me hear it by chance! Really, Cynthia, I think you're very unkind. And pray what made you refuse Mr. Henderson? Such a fine young man,--and such a gentleman! Your uncle told me he had a very good private fortune besides.\"\"Mamma, do you forget that I have promised to marry Roger Hamley?\" said Cynthia quietly.\"No! of course I don't--how can I, with Molly always dinning the word 'engagement' into my ears? But really, when one considers all the uncertainties,--and after all it was not a distinct promise,--he seemed almost as if he might have looked forward to something of this sort.\"\"Of what sort, mamma?\" said Cynthia, sharply.\"Why, of a more eligible offer. He must have known you might change your mind, and meet with some one you liked better: so little as you had seen of the world.\" Cynthia made an impatient movement, as if to stop her mother.\"I never said I liked him better,--how can you talk so, mamma? I'm going to marry Roger, and there's an end of it. I will not be spoken to about it again.\" She got up and left the room.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Cynthia's mother confronts her about refusing a marriage proposal from Mr. Henderson. Cynthia's mother believes that Mr. Henderson is a fine young man and wonders why Cynthia turned him down. Cynthia calmly reminds her mother that she has already promised to marry Roger Hamley. Her mother suggests that Cynthia may have received a more eligible offer and questions her decision. Cynthia becomes frustrated and leaves the room, refusing to discuss the matter further.\n","------\n","\n","\n","682\n","\"Certainly,--\" began Molly; but then she remembered that her stepmother was far from strong, and unable to bear a protest in favour of the right course without irritation. So she changed her speech into a suggestion of remedies for palpitation; and curbed her impatience to speak out her indignation at the contemplated falsehood to Roger. But when they were alone, and Cynthia began upon the subject, Molly was less merciful. Cynthia said,--\"Well, Molly, and now you know all! I've been longing to tell you--and yet somehow I could not.\"\"I suppose it was a repetition of Mr. Coxe,\" said Molly, gravely. \"You were agreeable,--and he took it for something more.\"\"I don't know,\" sighed Cynthia. \"I mean I don't know if I was agreeable or not. He was very kind--very pleasant--but I did not expect it all to end as it did. However, it's of no use thinking of it.\"\"No!\" said Molly, simply; for to her mind the pleasantest and kindest person in the world put in comparison with Roger was as nothing; he stood by himself. Cynthia's next words,--and they did not come very soon,--were on quite a different subject, and spoken in rather a pettish tone. Nor did she allude again in jesting sadness to her late efforts at virtue.\n","------\n","Molly is hesitant to speak out against her stepmother's plan because she doesn't want to upset her. However, when she is alone with Cynthia, Molly expresses her indignation at the planned falsehood. Cynthia admits that she was not sure if she was being agreeable or if Mr. Coxe misinterpreted her actions. Molly believes that Roger is far superior to anyone else and Cynthia changes the subject, speaking in a pettish tone. Cynthia does not mention her previous efforts at virtue again.\n","------\n","\n","\n","683\n","\"What's the matter, dear mamma? Are not you tiring yourself with talking?\"\"No, not at all!

Such nonsense! Really, Clare, your husband has spoilt you sadly, if you can't listen to any one without thinking they are alluding to you. People may flatter themselves just as much by thinking that their faults are always present to other people's minds, as if they believe that the world is always contemplating their individual charms and virtues.\"\"I was told, Lady Cumnor, that this silk was reduced in price.

You have much to answer for.\"\"Mamma, mamma!\" said Lady Harriet, \"Mr. Preston did not wish it spoken about.\" And at the same moment Mrs. Gibson exclaimed, \"Cynthia--Mr. Preston!\" in such a tone of surprise, that if Lady Cumnor had been in the habit of observing the revelations made by other people's tones and voices, she would have found out that Mrs. Gibson was ignorant of the affair to which she was alluding.\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is trying to justify the cost of a dress to Lady Harriet, but Lady Cumnor interrupts and criticizes Mrs. Gibson for spoiling her daughter, Cynthia. Lady Cumnor blames Cynthia's behavior towards Mr. Preston on her faulty education, and Mrs. Gibson is surprised to learn about this affair.\n","------\n","\n","\n","685\n","\"Indeed, Lady Cumnor--will you believe me?--I do not think Cynthia was ever engaged to Mr. Preston. There was an old flirtation. I was afraid--\"\"Ring the bell for Bradley,\" said Lady Cumnor, wearily: her eyes closed. Lady Harriet had too much experience of her mother's moods not to lead Mrs. Gibson away almost by main force, she protesting all the while that she did not think there was any truth in the statement, though it was dear Lady Cumnor that said it.Once in her own room, Lady Harriet said, \"Now, Clare, I'll tell you all about it; and I think you'll have to believe it, for it was Mr. Preston himself who told me. I heard of a great commotion in Hollingford about Mr. Preston; and I met him riding out, and asked him what it was all about; he didn't want to speak about it, evidently. No man does, I suppose, when he's been jilted; and he made both papa and me promise not to tell; but papa did--and that's what mamma has for a foundation; you see, a really good one.\"\"But Cynthia is engaged to another man--she really is. And another--a very good match indeed--has just been offering to her in London. Mr. Preston is always at the root of mischief.\"\n","------\n","Lady Cumnor believes that Cynthia was never engaged to Mr. Preston, despite there being an old flirtation between them. Lady Harriet takes Mrs. Gibson away and explains that Mr. Preston himself told her about the commotion in Hollingford regarding him. He had been jilted and didn't want to talk about it. Lady Harriet reveals that Cynthia is actually engaged to another man and that Mr. Preston is always causing trouble.\n","------\n","\n","\n","686\n","\"I don't know; I always feel as if he owed me a grudge, and men have so many ways of being spiteful. You must acknowledge that if he had not met you I should not have had dear Lady Cumnor so angry with me.\"\"She only wanted to warn you about Cynthia. Mamma has always been very particular about her own daughters. She has been very severe on the least approach to flirting, and Mary will be like her!\"\"But Cynthia will flirt, and I can't help it. She is not noisy, or giggling; she is always a lady--that everybody must own. But she has a way of attracting men, she must have inherited from me, I think.\" And here she smiled faintly, and would not have rejected a confirmatory compliment, but none came. \"However, I will speak to her; I will get to the bottom of the whole affair. Pray tell Lady Cumnor that it has so fluttered me the way she spoke, about my dress and all. And it only cost five guineas after all, reduced from eight!\"\"Well, never mind now. You are looking very much flushed; quite feverish! I left you too long in mamma's hot room. But do you know she is so much pleased to have you here?\" And so Lady Cumnor really was, in spite of the continual lectures which she gave \"Clare,\" and which poor Mrs. Gibson turned under as helplessly as the typical worm. Still it was something to have a countess to scold her; and that pleasure would endure when the worry was past. And then Lady Harriet petted her more than usual to make up for what she had to go through in the convalescent's room; and Lady Cuxhaven talked sense to her, with dashes of science and deep thought intermixed, which was very flattering, although generally unintelligible; and Lord Cumnor, good-natured, good-tempered, kind, and liberal, was full of gratitude to her for her kindness in coming to see Lady Cumnor, and his gratitude took the tangible shape of a haunch of venison, to say nothing of lesser game. When she looked back upon her visit, as she drove home in the solitary grandeur of the Towers' carriage, there had been but one great enduring rub--Lady Cumnor's crossness--and she chose to consider Cynthia as the cause of that, instead of seeing the truth, which had been so often set before her by the members of her ladyship's family, that it took its origin in her state of health. Mrs. Gibson did not exactly mean to visit this one discomfort upon Cynthia, nor did she quite mean to upbraid her daughter for conduct as yet unexplained, and which might have some justification; but, finding her quietly sitting in the drawing-room, she sate down despondingly in her own little easy chair, and in reply to Cynthia's quick pleasant greeting of--\n","------\n","The protagonist, Mrs. Gibson, is discussing her concerns about a man who she feels owes her a grudge.

I little thought when you were born how I should have to bear to hear you spoken about.\"Cynthia threw back her head, and angry light came into her eyes.\"What business have they with me? How came they to talk about me in any way?\"\"Everybody is talking about you; it is no wonder they are. Lord Cumnor is sure to hear about everything always. You should take more care about what you do, Cynthia, if you don't like being talked about.\"\"It rather depends upon what people say,\" said Cynthia, affecting a lightness which she did not feel; for she had a prevision of what was coming.\"Well! I don't like it, at any rate. It is not pleasant to me to hear first of my daughter's misdoings from Lady Cumnor, and then to be lectured about her, and her flirting, and her jilting, as if I had had anything to do with it.

The person they are visiting, Cynthia, asks what is wrong and the protagonist reveals that they are upset because people have been talking about Cynthia's behavior.

I must go. I cannot bear to think of him alone. When papa comes back he is sure to go to Hamley, and if I am not wanted, I can come back with him.\" She heard Mrs. Gibson's voice following her in remonstrance, but she did not stay for words. She had to wait in the stable-yard, and she wondered how the messenger could bear to eat and drink the food and beer brought out to him by the servants. Her coming out had evidently interrupted the eager talk,--the questions and answers passing sharp to and fro; but she caught the words, \"all amongst the tangled grass,\" and \"the Squire would let none on us touch him: he took him up as if he was a baby; he had to rest many a time, and once he sate him down on the ground; but still he kept him in his arms; but we thought we should ne'er have gotten him up again--him and the body.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is helping Molly get dressed quickly because Molly wants to go somewhere urgently. Molly explains that she cannot bear the thought of someone being alone and wants to go to Hamley. She leaves despite Mrs. Gibson's objections and waits in the stable-yard.

They rode quick under the shadows of the hedgerow trees, but when they slackened speed, to go up a brow, or to give their horses breath, Molly heard those two little words again in her ears; and said them over again to herself, in hopes of forcing the sharp truth into her unwilling sense. But when they came in sight of the square stillness of the house, shining in the moonlight--the moon had risen by this time--Molly caught at her breath, and for an instant she thought she never could go in, and face the presence in that dwelling. One yellow light burnt steadily, spotting the silver shining with its earthly coarseness. The man pointed it out: it was almost the first word he had spoken since they had left Hollingford.\"It's the old nursery. They carried him there. The Squire broke down at the stair-foot, and they took him to the readiest place. I'll be bound for it the Squire is there hisself, and old Robin too.

She did not speak, for she did not well know what to say, or how to present this homely want of nature before one so rapt in grief. But she put a spoonful to his lips, and touched them with the savoury food, as if he had been a sick child, and she the nurse; and instinctively he took down the first spoonful of the soup. But in a minute he said, with a sort of cry, and almost overturning the basin Molly held, by his passionate gesture as he pointed to the bed,--\"He will never eat again--never.\"Then he threw himself across the corpse, and wept in such a terrible manner that Molly trembled lest he also should die--should break his heart there and then. He took no more notice of her words, of her tears, of her presence, than he did of that of the moon, looking through the unclosed window, with passionless stare. Her father stood by them both before either of them was aware.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, a man is grieving over the death of someone and hasn't eaten since breakfast. A woman named Molly offers him some soup, but he realizes that the person he is grieving for will never eat again. He becomes overwhelmed with grief and cries uncontrollably.

He said she was a Frenchwoman and a Roman Catholic; and I think he said she was a servant,\" added Molly.\n","------\n","The plot of this paragraph revolves around a secret that Molly knows about Osborne being married. She reveals to her father that she overheard a conversation between Osborne and Roger in the library, where Osborne mentioned his wife. Molly promised to keep it a secret, but recently Osborne gave her his wife's address under the same condition. Molly reveals that Osborne's wife is a Frenchwoman and a Roman Catholic, possibly a servant, and is living in the south near Winchester.\n","------\n","\n","\n","710\n","\"And,\" continued Molly, \"he spoke of a child.

Molly sate still without speaking, too tired to do more than wait.\"Well!\" said he at last, jumping up, \"nothing can be done to-night; by to-morrow morning, perhaps, I may find out. Poor little pale face!\"--taking it between both his hands and kissing it; \"poor, sweet, little pale face!\" Then he rang the bell, and told Robinson to send some maid-servant to take Miss Gibson to her room.\"He won't be up early,\" said he, in parting. \"The shock has lowered him too much to be energetic. Send breakfast up to him in his own room. I'll be here again before ten.\"Late as it was before he left, he kept his word.\"Now, Molly,\" he said, \"you and I must tell him the truth between us.

Now that's a lie,\" Mr. Gibson said, turning round to Molly as soon as Robinson had left the room. \"I ought to be far enough away at twelve; but, if I'm not much mistaken, the innate habits of a gentleman will make him uneasy at the idea of keeping me waiting his pleasure, and will do more to bring him out of that room into this than any entreaties or reasoning.\" Mr. Gibson was growing impatient though, before they heard the Squire's footstep on the stairs; he was evidently coming slowly and unwillingly. He came in almost like one blind, groping along, and taking hold of chair or table for support or guidance till he reached Mr. Gibson. He did not speak when he held the doctor by the hand; he only hung down his head, and kept on a feeble shaking of welcome.\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson is trying to speak with the Squire, but the Squire refuses to see him.

Suddenly her father spoke,--\"Where's Roger?\" said he. \"Is he not likely to be soon at the Cape?\" He got up and looked at the directions of one or two unopened letters brought by that morning's post; among them was one in Cynthia's handwriting. Both Molly and he saw it at the same time. How long it was since yesterday! But the Squire took no notice of their proceedings or their looks.\"You will be glad to have Roger at home as soon as may be, I think, sir. Some months must elapse first; but I'm sure he will return as speedily as possible.\"The Squire said something in a very low voice. Both father and daughter strained their ears to hear what it was.

The Squire himself was the first to speak again,--\"He was my first child, sir; my eldest son. And of late years we weren't\"--his voice broke down, but he controlled himself--\"we weren't quite as good friends as could be wished; and I'm not sure--not sure that he knew how I loved him.\" And now he cried aloud with an exceeding bitter cry.\"Better so!\" whispered Mr. Gibson to Molly. \"When he's a little calmer, don't be afraid; tell him all you know, exactly as it happened.\"Molly began. Her voice sounded high and unnatural to herself, as if some one else was speaking, but she made her words clear.

A stranger might have imagined her to be his daughter instead of Mr. Gibson's. The meek, broken-down, considerate ways of the bereaved father never showed themselves more strongly than when he called them back to his chair, out of which he seemed too languid to rise, and said, as if by an after-thought: \"Give my love to Miss Kirkpatrick; tell her I look upon her as quite one of the family.

I can't forgive him, even though he is dead, poor fellow!\"\"Well, as he never did pay either of us any particular attention, and as we neither of us did fall in love with him, I think I only feel sorry that he had all the trouble and worry of concealment.\" Cynthia spoke with a pretty keen recollection of how much trouble and worry her concealment had cost her.\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson informs the protagonist that Osborne Hamley, who appeared to be a bachelor, is actually married and has a child. She expresses her anger and disappointment at his deceit, fearing that he could have broken the hearts of the protagonist or her sister, Molly. However, the protagonist, Cynthia, reveals that neither of them had any romantic interest in Osborne and only feels sorry for the trouble he went through to keep his marriage a secret. Cynthia's response is influenced by her own experience of hiding her\n","------\n","\n","\n","724\n","\"He hasn't read Cynthia's letter yet. Oh, do let me bring it home unopened,\" said Molly. \"Send another letter to Roger--now--at once; it will reach him at the same time; he will get both when he arrives at the Cape, and make him understand which is the last--the real one. Think! he will hear of Osborne's death at the same time--two such sad things! Do, Cynthia!\"\"No, my dear,\" said Mrs. Gibson. \"I could not allow that, even if Cynthia felt inclined for it. Asking to be re-engaged to him! At any rate, she must wait now until he proposes again, and we see how things turn out.\"But Molly kept her pleading eyes fixed on Cynthia.\"No!\" said Cynthia firmly, but not without consideration. \"It cannot be. I've felt more content this last night than I've done for weeks past. I'm glad to be free. I dreaded Roger's goodness, and learning, and all that. It was not in my way, and I don't believe I should have ever married him, even without knowing of all these ill-natured stories that are circulating about me, and which he would hear of, and expect me to explain, and be sorry for, and penitent and humble. I know he could not have made me happy, and I don't believe he would have been happy with me. It must stay as it is. I would rather be a governess than married to him. I should get weary of him every day of my life.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia has written a letter to Roger, but Molly suggests that they bring it home unopened and send another letter to him instead. Molly believes that Roger should receive both letters at the same time, along with the news of Osborne's death. However, Mrs. Gibson disagrees and thinks that Cynthia should wait for Roger to propose again. Despite Molly's pleading, Cynthia firmly decides that she does not want to be re-engaged to Roger. She feels content with her decision and believes that she would not\n","------\n","\n","\n","725\n","\"Very well. I must take my chance. And too much love is rather oppressive to me, I believe. I like a great deal, widely spread about; not all confined to one individual lover.\"\"I don't believe you,\" said Molly. \"But don't let us talk any more about it. It is best as it is. I thought--I almost felt sure you would be sorry this morning. But we will leave it alone now.\" She sate silently looking out of the window, her heart sorely stirred, she scarcely knew how or why. But she could not have spoken. Most likely she would have begun to cry if she had spoken. Cynthia stole softly up to her after a while.\"You are vexed with me, Molly,\" she began in a low voice. But Molly turned sharply round:\"I! I have no business at all in the affair. It is for you to judge. Do what you think right. I believe you have done right. Only I don't want to discuss it, and paw it over with talk. I'm very much tired, dear\"--gently now she spoke--\"and I hardly know what I say. If I speak crossly, don't mind it.\" Cynthia did not reply at once. Then she said,--\n","------\n","Molly and Cynthia are having a conversation about love. Molly expresses that she prefers to have love spread out among many people rather than being confined to one individual lover. Molly seems upset and doesn't want to discuss the matter further.

Molly is tired and asks Cynthia not to mind if she speaks crossly.\n","------\n","\n","\n","726\n","\"I cannot tell; I have no right to say,\" replied Molly, scarcely understanding Cynthia's motives, which, after all, were only impulses in this case. \"Papa would be able to judge; I think, perhaps, you had better not. But don't go by my opinion; I can only tell what I should wish to do in your place.\"\"It was as much for your sake as any one's, Molly,\" said Cynthia.\"Oh, then, don't! I am tired to-day with sitting up; but to-morrow I shall be all right; and I should not like it, if, for my sake, you came into the house at so solemn a time.\"\"Very well!\" said Cynthia, half-glad that her impulsive offer was declined; for, as she said, thinking to herself, \"It would have been awkward after all.\" So Molly went back in the carriage alone, wondering how she should find the Squire; wondering what discoveries he had made among Osborne's papers, and at what conviction he would have arrived.\n","------\n","Molly and Cynthia are having a conversation about whether or not Cynthia should go into the house. Molly is unsure and suggests that Cynthia ask their father for his opinion. Cynthia explains that she made the offer for Molly's sake, but Molly insists that she doesn't want Cynthia to come into the house at such a solemn time. Cynthia is relieved that her offer was declined and Molly wonders what their father has discovered in Osborne's papers.\n","------\n","\n","\n","727\n","LIII.UNLOOKED-FOR ARRIVALS.Robinson opened the door for Molly almost before the carriage had fairly drawn up at the Hall, and told her that the Squire had been very anxious for her return, and had more than once sent him to an upstairs window, from which a glimpse of the hill-road between Hollingford and Hamley could be caught, to know if the carriage was not yet in sight. Molly went into the drawing-room. The Squire was standing in the middle of the floor awaiting her--in fact, longing to go out and meet her, but restrained by a feeling of solemn etiquette, which prevented his moving about as usual in that house of mourning. He held a paper in his hands, which were trembling with excitement and emotion; and four or five open letters were strewed on a table near him.\"It's all true,\" he began; \"she's his wife, and he's her husband--was her husband--that's the word for it--was! Poor lad! poor lad! it's cost him a deal. Pray God, it wasn't my fault. Read this, my dear. It's a certificate. It's all regular--Osborne Hamley to Marie-AimÄe Scherer,--parish-church and all, and witnessed. Oh, dear!\" He sate down in the nearest chair and groaned. Molly took a seat by him, and read the legal paper, the perusal of which was not needed to convince her of the fact of the marriage. She held it in her hand after she had finished reading it, waiting for the Squire's next coherent words; for he kept talking to himself in broken sentences. \"Ay, ay! that comes o' temper, and crabbedness. She was the only one as could,--and I've been worse since she was gone. Worse! worse! and see what it has come to! He was afraid of me--ay--afraid. That's the truth of it--afraid. And it made him keep all to himself, and care killed him. They may call it heart-disease--O my lad, my lad, I know better now; but it's too late--that's the sting of it--too late, too late!\" He covered his face, and moved himself backward and forward till Molly could bear it no longer.\n","------\n","Molly returns to the Hall and finds the Squire waiting for her. He reveals that Osborne Hamley was married to Marie-Aimée Scherer and shows Molly the legal certificate. The Squire blames himself for Osborne's death, believing that his own temper and crabbedness caused Osborne to keep his troubles to himself and ultimately led to his demise. The Squire is overcome with grief and Molly is unable to bear his anguish.\n","------\n","\n","\n","728\n","\"Ay, read 'em, read 'em,\" said he. \"Maybe you can. I can only pick out a word here and there. I put 'em there for you to look at; and tell me what is in 'em.\"Molly's knowledge of written French of the present day was not so great as her knowledge of the French of the _MÄmoires de Sully_, and neither the spelling nor the writing of the letters was of the best; but she managed to translate into good enough colloquial English some innocent sentences of love, and submission to Osborne's will--as if his judgment was infallible,--and of faith in his purposes,--little sentences in \"little language\" that went home to the Squire's heart. Perhaps if Molly had read French more easily she might not have translated them into such touching, homely, broken words. Here and there, there were expressions in English; these the hungry-hearted Squire had read while waiting for Molly's return. Every time she stopped, he said, \"Go on.\" He kept his face shaded, and only repeated those two words at every pause. She got up to find some more of AimÄe's letters. In examining the papers, she came upon one in particular. \"Have you seen this, sir? This certificate of baptism\" (reading aloud) \"of Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley, born June 21, 183--, child of Osborne Hamley and Marie-AimÄe his wife--\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Molly is reading a collection of letters to the Squire. She struggles to understand the French language, but manages to translate some sentences of love and submission to Osborne's will. The Squire is deeply moved by these translations and eagerly urges Molly to continue reading. Molly then discovers a certificate of baptism for Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley, the child of Osborne Hamley and Marie-Aimée.\n","------\n","\n","\n","729\n","From the general tone of the letters, Molly doubted if the mother would consent, so easily as the Squire seemed to expect, to be parted from her child; the letters were not very wise, perhaps (though of this Molly never thought), but a heart full of love spoke tender words in every line. Still, it was not for Molly to talk of this doubt of hers just then; but rather to dwell on the probable graces and charms of the little Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley. She let the Squire exhaust himself in wondering as to the particulars of every event, helping him out in conjectures; and both of them, from their imperfect knowledge of possibilities, made the most curious, fantastic, and improbable guesses at the truth. And so that day passed over, and the night came.There were not many people who had any claim to be invited to the funeral, and of these Mr. Gibson and the Squire's hereditary man of business had taken charge. But when Mr. Gibson came, early on the following morning, Molly referred the question to him, which had suggested itself to her mind, though apparently not to the Squire's, what intimation of her loss should be sent to the widow, living solitary near Winchester, watching and waiting, if not for his coming who lay dead in his distant home, at least for his letters. One from her had already come, in her foreign handwriting, to the post-office to which all her communications were usually sent, but of course they at the Hall knew nothing of this.\n","------\n","Molly is reading letters that suggest the mother of a child named Roger may not want to be separated from him. Molly and the Squire speculate about the child's future and make guesses about what might happen. The next day, Mr. Gibson arrives and Molly asks him about notifying the child's mother of his death.\n","------\n","\n","\n","730\n","\"Yes, she must,\" replied his daughter. \"But how?\"\"A day or two of waiting will do no harm,\" said he, almost as if he was anxious to delay the solution of the problem. \"It will make her anxious, poor thing, and all sorts of gloomy possibilities will suggest themselves to her mind--amongst them the truth; it will be a kind of preparation.\"\"For what? Something must be done at last,\" said Molly.\"Yes; true. Suppose you write, and say he's very ill; write to-morrow. I daresay they've indulged themselves in daily postage, and then she'll have had three days' silence. You say how you come to know all you do about it; I think she ought to know he is very ill--in great danger, if you like: and you can follow it up next day with the full truth. I wouldn't worry the Squire about it. After the funeral we will have a talk about the child.\"\"She will never part with it,\" said Molly.\"Whew! Till I see the woman I can't tell,\" said her father; \"some women would. It will be well provided for, according to what you say. And she is a foreigner, and may very likely wish to go back to her own people and kindred. There's much to be said on both sides.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, a father and daughter are discussing a problem that involves a woman who must make a decision. The father suggests delaying the solution to make the woman anxious and prepare her for the truth. The daughter insists that something must be done eventually. The father proposes that the daughter write a letter to the woman, saying that the man is very ill, and then follow up with the full truth the next day. The father also mentions that after the funeral, they will discuss the fate of a child\n","------\n","\n","\n","731\n","\"So you always say, daughter. Time will show. So the child is a boy? Mrs. Gibson told me particularly to ask. It will go far to reconciling her to Cynthia's dismissal of Roger. But indeed it is quite as well for both of them, though of course he will be a long time before he thinks so. They were not suited to each other. Poor Roger! It was hard work writing to him yesterday; and who knows what may have become of him! Well, well! one has to get through the world somehow. I'm glad, however, this little lad has turned up to be the heir. I shouldn't have liked the property to go to the Irish Hamleys, who are the next heirs, as Osborne once told me. Now write that letter, Molly, to the poor little Frenchwoman out yonder. It will prepare her for it; and we must think a bit how to spare her the shock, for Osborne's sake.\"The writing this letter was rather difficult work for Molly, and she tore up two or three copies before she could manage it to her satisfaction; and at last, in despair of ever doing it better, she sent it off without re-reading it. The next day was easier; the fact of Osborne's death was told briefly and tenderly. But when this second letter was sent off, Molly's heart began to bleed for the poor creature, bereft of her husband, in a foreign land, and he at a distance from her, dead and buried without her ever having had the chance of printing his dear features on her memory by one last long lingering look. With her thoughts full of the unknown AimÄe, Molly talked much about her that day to the Squire. He would listen for ever to any conjecture, however wild, about the grandchild, but perpetually winced away from all discourse about \"the Frenchwoman,\" as he called her; not unkindly, but to his mind she was simply the Frenchwoman--chattering, dark-eyed, demonstrative, and possibly even rouged. He would treat her with respect as his son's widow, and would try even not to think upon the female inveiglement in which he believed. He would make her an allowance to the extent of his duty: but he hoped and trusted he might never be called upon to see her. His solicitor, Gibson, anybody and everybody, should be called upon to form a phalanx of defence against that danger.\n","------\n","The paragraph discusses the relationship between Cynthia and Roger, and the arrival of a child who is believed to be the heir to a property. The narrator mentions the difficulty of writing a letter to inform someone of Osborne's death, and expresses sympathy for the widow who is in a foreign land. The Squire, however, is not interested in discussing the widow and hopes to avoid seeing her.\n","------\n","\n","\n","732\n","\"Hamley Hall!\" said the innkeeper. \"Eh! there's a deal o' trouble there just now.\"\"I know, I know,\" said she, hastening off after the wheelbarrow in which her trunk was going, and breathlessly struggling to keep up with it, her heavy child asleep in her arms. Her pulses beat all over her body; she could hardly see out of her eyes. To her, a foreigner, the drawn blinds of the house, when she came in sight of it, had no significance; she hurried, stumbled on.\"Back door or front, missus?\" asked the boots from the inn.\"The most nearest,\" said she. And the front door was \"the most nearest.\" Molly was sitting with the Squire in the darkened drawing-room, reading out her translations of AimÄe's letters to her husband. The Squire was never weary of hearing them; the very sound of Molly's voice soothed and comforted him, it was so sweet and low. And he pulled her up, much as a child does, if on a second reading of the same letter she substituted one word for another. The house was very still this afternoon,--still as it had been now for several days; every servant in it, however needlessly, moving about on tiptoe, speaking below the breath, and shutting doors as softly as might be. The nearest noise or stir of active life was that of the rooks in the trees, who were beginning their spring chatter of business. Suddenly, through this quiet, there came a ring at the front-door bell that sounded, and went on sounding, through the house, pulled by an ignorant vigorous hand. Molly stopped reading; she and the Squire looked at each other in surprised dismay. Perhaps a thought of Roger's sudden (and impossible) return was in the mind of each; but neither spoke. They heard Robinson hurrying to answer the unwonted summons. They listened; but they heard no more. There was little more to hear. When the old servant opened the door, a lady with a child in her arms stood there. She gasped out her ready-prepared English sentence,--\n","------\n","The paragraph describes a woman, who is a foreigner, arriving at Hamley Hall. She is in a hurry and struggling to keep up with her trunk on a wheelbarrow. The innkeeper mentions that there is trouble at Hamley Hall.

The house is quiet and the servants are moving around quietly. Suddenly, there is a loud ring at\n","------\n","\n","\n","733\n","Robinson had been aware that there was some mystery, long suspected by the servants, and come to light at last to the master,--he had guessed that there was a young woman in the case; but when she stood there before him, asking for her dead husband as if he were living, any presence of mind Robinson might have had forsook him; he could not tell her the truth,--he could only leave the door open, and say to her, \"Wait awhile, I'll come back,\" and betake himself to the drawing-room where Molly was, he knew. He went up to her in a flutter and a hurry, and whispered something to her which turned her white with dismay.\"What is it? What is it?\" said the Squire, trembling with excitement. \"Don't keep it from me. I can bear it. Roger--\"They both thought he was going to faint; he had risen up and come close to Molly; suspense would be worse than anything.\"Mrs. Osborne Hamley is here,\" said Molly. \"I wrote to tell her her husband was very ill, and she has come.\"\"She does not know what has happened, seemingly,\" said Robinson.\n","------\n","Robinson, the master of the house, had suspected that there was a mystery involving a young woman, which the servants had also suspected. When the young woman, Mrs. Osborne Hamley, appeared before him asking for her supposedly dead husband, Robinson was unable to tell her the truth.

The Squire, who was also present, became anxious\n","------\n","\n","\n","734\n","Molly stood for a moment or two, irresolute. She, too, shrank from the interview. Robinson put in his word: \"She looks but a weakly thing, and has carried a big baby, choose how far, I didn't stop to ask.\"At this instant the door softly opened, and right into the midst of them came the little figure in grey, looking ready to fall with the weight of her child.\"You are Molly,\" said she, not seeing the Squire at once. \"The lady who wrote the letter; he spoke of you sometimes. You will let me go to him.\"Molly did not answer, except that at such moments the eyes speak solemnly and comprehensively. AimÄe read their meaning. All she said was,--\"He is not--oh, my husband--my husband!\" Her arms relaxed, her figure swayed, the child screamed and held out his arms for help. That help was given him by his grandfather, just before AimÄe fell senseless on the floor.\"Maman, maman!\" cried the little fellow, now striving and fighting to get back to her, where she lay; he fought so lustily that the Squire had to put him down, and he crawled to the poor inanimate body, behind which sat Molly, holding the head; whilst Robinson rushed away for water, wine, and more womankind.\n","------\n","Molly is hesitant to meet someone, and Robinson comments on her appearance. Just as they are talking, a woman enters the room with a child and addresses Molly. The woman is looking for her husband and collapses, causing the child to cry out for help. The Squire takes the child, and Molly supports the woman's head while Robinson goes to get help.\n","------\n","\n","\n","735\n","\"Poor thing, poor thing!\" said the Squire, bending over her, and crying afresh over her suffering. \"She is but young, Molly, and she must ha' loved him dearly.\"\"To be sure!\" said Molly, quickly. She was untying the bonnet, and taking off the worn, but neatly mended gloves; there was the soft luxuriant black hair, shading the pale, innocent face,--the little notable-looking brown hands, with the wedding-ring for sole ornament. The child clustered his fingers round one of hers, and nestled up against her with his plaintive cry, getting more and more into a burst of wailing: \"Maman, maman!\" At the growing acuteness of his imploring, her hand moved, her lips quivered, consciousness came partially back. She did not open her eyes, but great heavy tears stole out from beneath her eyelashes. Molly held her head against her own breast; and they tried to give her wine,--which she shrank from--water, which she did not reject; that was all. At last she tried to speak. \"Take me away,\" she said, \"into the dark. Leave me alone.\"\n","------\n","The Squire and Molly are tending to a young woman who is suffering. The woman is described as young and it is implied that she has lost someone she loved. She has black hair, a pale face, and is wearing a wedding ring. A child is with her, crying and calling for his mother. The woman is conscious but weak, and she asks to be taken away and left alone in the dark.\n","------\n","\n","\n","736\n","\"Food--bread and milk for baby.\" But when they brought her food herself, she only shrank away and turned her face to the wall without a word. In the hurry, the child had been left with Robinson and the Squire. For some unknown, but most fortunate reason, he took a dislike to Robinson's red face and hoarse voice, and showed a most decided preference for his grandfather. When Molly came down she found the Squire feeding the child, with more of peace upon his face than there had been for all these days. The boy was every now and then leaving off taking his bread and milk to show his dislike to Robinson by word and gesture: a proceeding which only amused the old servant, while it highly delighted the more favoured Squire.\"She is lying very still, but she will neither speak nor eat. I don't even think she is crying,\" said Molly, volunteering this account, for the Squire was for the moment too much absorbed in his grandson to ask many questions.Robinson put in his word: \"Dick Hayward, he's Boots at the Hamley Arms, says the coach she come by started at five this morning from London, and the passengers said she'd been crying a deal on the road, when she thought folks were not noticing; and she never came in to meals with the rest, but stopped feeding her child.\"\n","------\n","The paragraph describes a scene where a woman, referred to as \"she,\" is refusing to eat or speak. The child is left with Robinson and the Squire, who the child prefers over Robinson. The Squire is seen feeding the child, and the child shows dislike towards Robinson. The woman is described as lying still and not crying. Robinson mentions that the woman had been crying during her journey and had not been eating with the others.\n","------\n","\n","\n","737\n","But Molly stole out, and sent off a lad to Hollingford with a note to her father. Her heart had warmed towards the poor stranger, and she felt uncertain as to what ought to be the course pursued in her case.She went up from time to time to look at the girl, scarce older than herself, who lay there with her eyes open, but as motionless as death. She softly covered her over, and let her feel the sympathetic presence from time to time; and that was all she was allowed to do. The Squire was curiously absorbed in the child, but Molly's supreme tenderness was for the mother. Not but what she admired the sturdy, gallant, healthy little fellow, whose every limb, and square inch of clothing, showed the tender and thrifty care that had been taken of him. By-and-by the Squire said in a whisper,--\"She's not like a Frenchwoman, is she, Molly?\"\"I don't know. I don't know what Frenchwomen are like. People say Cynthia is French.\"\"And she didn't look like a servant? We won't speak of Cynthia since she's served my Roger so. Why, I began to think, as soon as I could think after _that_, how I would make Roger and her happy, and have them married at once; and then came that letter! I never wanted her for a daughter-in-law, not I. But he did, it seems; and he wasn't one for wanting many things for himself. But it's all over now; only we won't talk of her; and maybe, as you say, she was more French than English. This poor thing looks like a gentlewoman, I think. I hope she's got friends who'll take care of her,--she can't be above twenty. I thought she must be older than my poor lad!\"\n","------\n","Molly, a young girl, feels sympathy towards a stranger who is lying motionless and unconscious. She takes care of the stranger, covering her and offering her presence. The Squire, who is also present, is absorbed in the stranger's child, but Molly's main concern is for the mother.

The Squire hopes that the stranger\n","------\n","\n","\n","738\n","\"Nay, nay!\" said the Squire. \"It's not so easy to break one's heart. Sometimes I've wished it were. But one has to go on living--'all the appointed days,' as it says in the Bible. But we'll do our best for her. We'll not think of letting her go away till she's fit to travel.\"Molly wondered in her heart about this going away, on which the Squire seemed fully resolved. She was sure that he intended to keep the child; perhaps he had a legal right to do so;--but would the mother ever part from it? Her father, however, would solve the difficulty,--her father, whom she always looked to as so clear-seeing and experienced. She watched and waited for his coming. The February evening drew on; the child lay asleep in the Squire's arms till his grandfather grew tired, and laid him down on the sofa: the large square-cornered yellow sofa upon which Mrs. Hamley used to sit, supported by pillows in a half-reclining position. Since her time it had been placed against the wall, and had served merely as a piece of furniture to fill up the room. But once again a human figure was lying upon it; a little human creature, like a cherub in some old Italian picture. The Squire remembered his wife as he put the child down.

Molly judged from the look in his eye that he had been fully informed of the present state of things at the Hall by some one. But he simply went up to and greeted the Squire, and waited to hear what was said to him. The Squire was fumbling at the taper on the writing-table, and before he answered much he lighted it, and signing to his friend to follow him, he went softly to the sofa and showed him the sleeping child, taking the utmost care not to arouse it by flare or sound.\"Well! this is a fine young gentleman,\" said Mr. Gibson, returning to the fire rather sooner than the Squire expected. \"And you've got the mother here, I understand. Mrs. Osborne Hamley, as we must call her, poor thing! It's a sad coming home to her; for I hear she knew nothing of his death.\" He spoke without exactly addressing any one, so that either Molly or the Squire might answer as they liked. The Squire said,--\"Yes! She's felt it a terrible shock. She's upstairs in the best bedroom. I should like you to see her, Gibson, if she'll let you. We must do our duty by her, for my poor lad's sake. I wish he could have seen his boy lying there; I do. I daresay it preyed on him to have to keep it all to himself. He might ha' known me, though.

They went into the room where she had been taken. She lay quite still in the same position as at first. Her eyes were open and tearless, fixed on the wall. Mr. Gibson spoke to her, but she did not answer; he lifted her hand to feel her pulse; she never noticed.\"Bring me some wine at once, and order some beef-tea,\" he said to Molly.But when he tried to put the wine into her mouth as she lay there on her side, she made no effort to receive or swallow it, and it ran out upon the pillow. Mr. Gibson left the room abruptly; Molly chafed the little inanimate hand; the Squire stood by in dumb dismay, touched in spite of himself by the death-in-life of one so young, and who must have been so much beloved.Mr. Gibson came back two steps at a time; he was carrying the half-awakened child in his arms. He did not scruple to rouse him into yet further wakefulness--did not grieve to hear him begin to wail and cry. His eyes were on the figure upon the bed, which at that sound quivered all through; and when her child was laid at her back, and began caressingly to scramble yet closer, AimÄe turned round, and took him in her arms, and lulled him and soothed him with the soft wont of mother's love.\n","------\n","The protagonist, Mr. Gibson, is called by his daughter to see someone who is very ill.

Molly was struck by her father's low tones of comfort and sympathy, although she could not follow what was said quickly enough to catch the meaning of what passed.By-and-by, however, when her father had done all that he could, and they were once more downstairs, he told them more about her journey than they yet knew. The hurry, the sense of acting in defiance of a prohibition, the over-mastering anxiety, the broken night, and fatigue of the journey, had ill prepared her for the shock at last, and Mr. Gibson was seriously alarmed for the consequences. She had wandered strangely in her replies to him; he had perceived that she was wandering, and had made great efforts to recall her senses; but Mr. Gibson foresaw that some bodily illness was coming on, and stopped late that night, arranging many things with Molly and the Squire. One--the only--comfort arising from her state was the probability that she would be entirely unconscious by the morrow--the day of the funeral. Worn out by the contending emotions of the day, the Squire seemed now unable to look beyond the wrench and trial of the next twelve hours. He sate with his head in his hands, declining to go to bed, refusing to dwell on the thought of his grandchild--not three hours ago such a darling in his eyes. Mr. Gibson gave some instructions to one of the maid-servants as to the watch she was to keep by Mrs. Osborne Hamley, and insisted on Molly's going to bed. When she pleaded the apparent necessity of her staying up, he said,--\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson's daughter, Molly, is in a state of distress and confusion after a journey. Her father tries to comfort her and get her to eat and drink. He is concerned about her health and believes she may become unconscious the next day, which is the day of a funeral. The Squire, Molly's grandfather, is also distraught and unable to think beyond the next twelve hours. Mr. Gibson gives instructions for someone to watch over Mrs. Osborne Hamley and insists that Molly go\n","------\n","\n","\n","742\n","\"I am sure she was quite serious in wishing for that.\"\"Yes, yes! at the time. I've no doubt she thought she was sincere in intending to go. But the great thing was to get out of the unpleasantness of the present time and place; and uncle Kirkpatrick's will do this as effectually, and more pleasantly, than a situation at Nishni-Novgorod in an ice-palace.\"He had given Molly's thoughts a turn, which was what he wanted to do. Molly could not help remembering Mr. Henderson, and his offer, and all the consequent hints; and wondering, and wishing--what did she wish? or had she been falling asleep? Before she had quite ascertained this point she was asleep in reality.After this, long days passed over in a monotonous round of care; for no one seemed to think of Molly's leaving the Hall during the woeful illness that befell Mrs. Osborne Hamley. It was not that her father allowed her to take much active part in the nursing; the Squire gave him _carte-blanche_, and he engaged two efficient hospital nurses to watch over the unconscious AimÄe; but Molly was needed to receive the finer directions as to her treatment and diet. It was not that she was wanted for the care of the little boy; the Squire was too jealous of the child's exclusive love for that, and one of the housemaids was employed in the actual physical charge of him; but he needed some one to listen to his incontinence of language, both when his passionate regret for his dead son came uppermost, and also when he had discovered some extraordinary charm in that son's child; and again when he was oppressed with the uncertainty of AimÄe's long-continued illness. Molly was not so good or so bewitching a listener to ordinary conversation as Cynthia; but where her heart was interested her sympathy was deep and unfailing. In this case she only wished that the Squire could really feel that AimÄe was not the encumbrance which he evidently considered her to be. Not that he would have acknowledged the fact, if it had been put before him in plain words. He fought against the dim consciousness of what was in his mind; he spoke repeatedly of patience when no one but himself was impatient; he would often say that when she grew better she must not be allowed to leave the Hall until she was perfectly strong, when no one was even contemplating the remotest chance of her leaving her child, excepting only himself. Molly once or twice asked her father if she might not speak to the Squire, and represent the hardship of sending her away--the improbability that she would consent to quit her boy, and so on; but Mr. Gibson only replied,--\n","------\n","Molly is considering leaving the present time and place and wishes to go to Nishni-Novgorod. However, her thoughts are interrupted by Mr. Gibson, who wants to distract her. Molly then becomes preoccupied with caring for Mrs. Osborne Hamley during her illness and listening to the Squire's emotional outbursts. Molly wishes that the Squire would see that Mrs. Osborne Hamley and her child are not burdens, but she is unable to speak to him about it.\n","------\n","\n","\n","743\n","It was well that Molly was such a favourite with the old servants; for she had frequently to restrain and to control. To be sure, she had her father's authority to back her; and they were aware that where her own comfort, ease, or pleasure was concerned she never interfered, but submitted to their will. If the Squire had known of the want of attendance to which she submitted with the most perfect meekness, as far as she herself was the only sufferer, he would have gone into a towering rage. But Molly hardly thought of it, so anxious was she to do all she could for others, and to remember the various charges which her father gave her in his daily visits. Perhaps he did not spare her enough; she was willing and uncomplaining; but one day after Mrs. Osborne Hamley had \"taken the turn,\" as the nurses called it, when she was lying weak as a new-born baby, but with her faculties all restored, and her fever gone,--when spring buds were blooming out, and spring birds sang merrily,--Molly answered to her father's sudden questioning that she felt unaccountably weary; that her head ached heavily, and that she was aware of a sluggishness of thought which it required a painful effort to overcome.\n","------\n","Molly is a favorite with the old servants and often has to restrain and control them. She has her father's authority to support her, but she never interferes when it comes to her own comfort. Molly is willing to do anything for others and remembers her father's various charges. However, one day she feels unaccountably weary, her head aches, and she struggles with sluggishness of thought.\n","------\n","\n","\n","744\n","\"Don't go on,\" said Mr. Gibson, with a quick pang of anxiety, almost of remorse. \"Lie down here--with your back to the light. I'll come back and see you before I go.\" And off he went in search of the Squire. He had a good long walk before he came upon Mr. Hamley in a field of spring wheat, where the women were weeding, his little grandson holding to his finger in the intervals of short walks of inquiry into the dirtiest places, which was all his sturdy little limbs could manage.\"Well, Gibson, and how goes the patient? Better? I wish we could get her out of doors, such a fine day as it is. It would make her strong as soon as anything. I used to beg my poor lad to come out more. Maybe, I worried him; but the air is the finest thing for strengthening that I know of. Though, perhaps, she'll not thrive in English air as if she'd been born here; and she'll not be quite right till she gets back to her native place, wherever that is.\"\"I don't know. I begin to think we shall get her quite round here; and I don't know that she could be in a better place. But it's not about her. May I order the carriage for my Molly?\" Mr. Gibson's voice sounded as if he was choking a little as he said these last words.\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson is concerned about someone's health and goes to find the Squire to discuss it. They meet in a field where the Squire's grandson is playing. Mr. Gibson asks about the patient's condition and suggests that fresh air would be beneficial. The conversation then shifts to Mr. Gibson's daughter, Molly, and he asks if he can order a carriage for her. Mr. Gibson's voice indicates that he is emotional about the situation.\n","------\n","\n","\n","745\n","\"Nothing's the matter,\" said Mr. Gibson, hastily. \"Only I want her at home, under my own eye;\" and he turned away to go to the house. But the Squire left his field and his weeders, and kept at Mr. Gibson's side. He wanted to speak, but his heart was so full he did not know what to say. \"I say, Gibson,\" he got out at last, \"your Molly is liker a child of mine than a stranger; and I reckon we've all on us been coming too hard upon her. You don't think there's much amiss, do you?\"\"How can I tell?\" said Mr. Gibson, almost savagely. But any hastiness of temper was instinctively understood by the Squire; and he was not offended, though he did not speak again till they reached the house. Then he went to order the carriage, and stood by sorrowful enough while the horses were being put in. He felt as if he should not know what to do without Molly; he had never known her value, he thought, till now. But he kept silence on this view of the case; which was a praiseworthy effort on the part of one who usually let by-standers see and hear as much of his passing feelings as if he had had a window in his breast. He stood by while Mr. Gibson helped the faintly-smiling, tearful Molly into the carriage. Then the Squire mounted on the step and kissed her hand; but when he tried to thank her and bless her, he broke down; and as soon as he was once more safely on the ground, Mr. Gibson cried out to the coachman to drive on. And so Molly left Hamley Hall. From time to time her father rode up to the window, and made some little cheerful and apparently careless remark. When they came within two miles of Hollingford, he put spurs to his horse, and rode briskly past the carriage windows, kissing his hand to the occupant as he did so. He went on to prepare her home for Molly: when she arrived Mrs. Gibson was ready to greet her. Mr. Gibson had given one or two of his bright, imperative orders, and Mrs. Gibson was feeling rather lonely \"without either of her two dear girls at home,\" as she phrased it, to herself as well as to others.\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson wants his daughter, Molly, to come home and be under his supervision. The Squire, who considers Molly like a child of his own, accompanies Mr. Gibson and expresses concern for Molly's well-being. Mr. Gibson is unsure of what is wrong with Molly and is frustrated by the Squire's questions. The Squire is saddened by Molly's departure and kisses her hand before she leaves. Mr. Gibson rides ahead to prepare Molly's home, and Mrs. Gibson eagerly awaits\n","------\n","\n","\n","746\n","\"You'd better not call her anything, but let her get to her own room and have a good rest as soon as possible. Haven't you got a trashy novel or two in the house? That's the literature to send her to sleep.\"He did not leave her till he had seen her laid on a sofa in a darkened room, with some slight pretence of reading in her hand. Then he came away, leading his wife, who turned round at the door to kiss her hand to Molly, and make a little face of unwillingness to be dragged away.\"Now, Hyacinth,\" said he, as he took his wife into the drawing-room, \"she will need much care. She has been overworked, and I've been a fool. That's all. We must keep her from all worry and care,--but I won't answer for it that she'll not have an illness, for all that!\"\"Poor thing! she does look worn out. She is something like me, her feelings are too much for her. But now she is come home she shall find us as cheerful as possible. I can answer for myself; and you really must brighten up your doleful face, my dear--nothing so bad for invalids as the appearance of depression in those around them. I have had such a pleasant letter from Cynthia to-day. Uncle Kirkpatrick really seems to make so much of her, he treats her just like a daughter; he has given her a ticket to the Concerts of Ancient Music; and Mr. Henderson has been to call on her, in spite of all that has gone before.\"\n","------\n","A woman named Molly is being taken care of by a man and his wife. The man ensures that Molly is comfortable in her room and suggests that she read a trashy novel to help her sleep. The man's wife is concerned about Molly's well-being and promises to keep the atmosphere cheerful for her. The wife also mentions receiving a pleasant letter from someone named Cynthia and shares some positive news about Cynthia's interactions with Uncle Kirkpatrick and Mr. Henderson.\n","------\n","\n","\n","747\n","The illness which he apprehended came upon Molly; not violently or acutely, so that there was any immediate danger to be dreaded; but making a long pull upon her strength, which seemed to lessen day by day, until at last her father feared that she might become a permanent invalid. There was nothing very decided or alarming to tell Cynthia, and Mrs. Gibson kept the dark side from her in her letters. \"Molly was feeling the spring weather;\" or \"Molly had been a good deal overdone with her stay at the Hall, and was resting;\" such little sentences told nothing of Molly's real state. But then, as Mrs. Gibson said to herself, it would be a pity to disturb Cynthia's pleasure by telling her much about Molly; indeed, there was not much to tell, one day was so like another. But it so happened that Lady Harriet,--who came whenever she could to sit awhile with Molly, at first against Mrs. Gibson's will, and afterwards with her full consent,--for reasons of her own, Lady Harriet wrote a letter to Cynthia, to which she was urged by Mrs. Gibson. It fell out in this manner:--One day, when Lady Harriet was sitting in the drawing-room for a few minutes after she had been with Molly, she said,--\n","------\n","Molly has fallen ill, but not severely. Her father is worried that her illness may become chronic and make her a permanent invalid. Molly's mother, Mrs. Gibson, keeps the severity of Molly's condition hidden from her sister, Cynthia, in her letters. Lady Harriet, who visits Molly regularly, writes a letter to Cynthia at the urging of Mrs. Gibson, revealing Molly's true state of health.\n","------\n","\n","\n","748\n","\"Really, Clare, I spend so much time in your house that I'm going to establish a work-basket here. Mary has infected me with her notability, and I'm going to work mamma a footstool. It is to be a surprise; and so if I do it here she will know nothing about it. Only I cannot match the gold beads I want for the pansies in this dear little town; and Hollingford, who could send me down stars and planets if I asked him, I make no doubt, could no more match beads than--\"\"My dear Lady Harriet! you forget Cynthia! Think what a pleasure it would be to her to do anything for you.\"\"Would it? Then she shall have plenty of it; but mind, it is you who have answered for her. She shall get me some wool too; how good I am to confer so much pleasure on a fellow-creature! But seriously, do you think I might write and give her a few commissions? Neither Agnes nor Mary are in town--\"\"I am sure she would be delighted,\" said Mrs. Gibson, who also took into consideration the reflection of aristocratic honour that would fall upon Cynthia if she had a letter from Lady Harriet while at Mr. Kirkpatrick's. So she gave the address, and Lady Harriet wrote. All the first part of the letter was taken up with apology and commissions; but then, never doubting but that Cynthia was aware of Molly's state, she went on to say--\n","------\n","Lady Harriet spends a lot of time at Clare's house and wants to establish a work-basket there. She plans to make a footstool for her mother as a surprise. Lady Harriet realizes she doesn't have the right beads for the project and asks Clare if she can ask Cynthia to help her find them. Clare agrees and gives Lady Harriet Cynthia's address. Lady Harriet then writes a letter to Cynthia, apologizing for the commissions and asking for her help.\n","------\n","\n","\n","749\n","The day but one after this letter was despatched, Cynthia walked into the drawing-room at home with as much apparent composure as if she had left it not an hour before. Mrs. Gibson was dozing, but believing herself to be reading; she had been with Molly the greater part of the morning, and now after her lunch, and the invalid's pretence of early dinner, she considered herself entitled to some repose. She started up as Cynthia came in:\"Cynthia! Dear child, where have you come from? Why in the world have you come? My poor nerves! My heart is quite fluttering; but, to be sure, it's no wonder with all this anxiety I have to undergo. Why have you come back?\"\"Because of the anxiety you speak of, mamma. I never knew,--you never told me how ill Molly was.\"\"Nonsense! I beg your pardon, my dear, but it's really nonsense. Molly's illness is only nervous, Mr. Gibson says. A nervous fever; but you must remember nerves are mere fancy, and she's getting better. Such a pity for you to have left your uncle's. Who told you about Molly?\"\n","------\n","Cynthia returns home and finds her mother, Mrs. Gibson, dozing in the drawing-room. Mrs. Gibson is surprised and flustered by Cynthia's sudden arrival and asks why she has come back. Cynthia explains that she came back because she was not aware of how ill Molly, presumably her sister, was. Mrs. Gibson dismisses Molly's illness as just a nervous fever and believes that she is getting better. She questions who told Cynthia about Molly's condition.\n","------\n","\n","\n","750\n","\"I know,--I know. But you might have known she always exaggerates things. Not but what I have been almost worn out with nursing. Perhaps, after all, it is a very good thing you have come, my dear; and now you shall come down into the dining-room and have some lunch, and tell me all the Hyde Park Street news--into my room,--don't go into yours yet--Molly is so sensitive to noise!\"While Cynthia ate her lunch, Mrs. Gibson went on questioning. \"And your aunt, how is her cold? And Helen, quite strong again? Margaretta as pretty as ever? The boys are at Harrow, I suppose? And my old favourite, Mr. Henderson?\" She could not manage to slip in this last inquiry naturally; in spite of herself there was a change of tone, an accent of eagerness. Cynthia did not reply on the instant; she poured herself out some water with great deliberation, and then said,--\"My aunt is quite well; Helen is as strong as she ever is, and Margaretta very pretty. The boys are at Harrow, and I conclude that Mr. Henderson is enjoying his usual health, for he was to dine at my uncle's to-day.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia is visiting Mrs. Gibson, who is eager to hear news about their acquaintances in Hyde Park Street. Cynthia mentions that her aunt is well, Helen is strong, Margaretta is pretty, and the boys are at Harrow. When asked about Mr. Henderson, Cynthia hesitates before saying that he is likely in good health and was expected to have dinner at her uncle's house.\n","------\n","\n","\n","751\n","\"On the contrary, I am to go back there as soon as ever I can be easy to leave Molly.\"\"'Easy to leave Molly.' Now that really is nonsense, and rather uncomplimentary to me, I must say: nursing her as I have been doing, daily, and almost nightly; for I have been wakened times out of number by Mr. Gibson getting up, and going to see if she had had her medicine properly.\"\"I'm afraid she has been very ill?\" asked Cynthia.\"Yes, she has, in one way; but not in another. It was what I call more a tedious, than an interesting illness. There was no immediate danger, but she lay much in the same state from day to day.\"\"I wish I had known!\" sighed Cynthia. \"Do you think I might go and see her now?\"\"I'll go and prepare her. You'll find her a good deal better than she has been. Ah; here's Mr. Gibson!\" He came into the dining-room, hearing voices. Cynthia thought that he looked much older.\"You here!\" said he, coming forward to shake hands. \"Why, how did you come?\"\"By the 'Umpire.' I never knew Molly had been so ill, or I would have come directly.\" Her eyes were full of tears. Mr. Gibson was touched; he shook her hand again, and murmured, \"You're a good girl, Cynthia.\"\n","------\n","The protagonist, Cynthia, expresses her desire to go back to a place called Molly as soon as possible. She mentions that Molly has been ill and that she has been taking care of her. Cynthia is surprised to learn about Molly's illness and wishes she had known earlier. She asks if she can go see Molly now, and the narrator mentions that Mr. Gibson, another character, enters the room and is surprised to see Cynthia there. He expresses gratitude towards Cynthia for her concern for Molly.\n","------\n","\n","\n","752\n","\"Very foolish,\" said Mr. Gibson, echoing his wife's words, but smiling at Cynthia. \"But sometimes one likes foolish people for their folly, better than wise people for their wisdom.\"\"I am afraid folly always annoys me,\" said his wife. \"However, Cynthia is here, and what is done, is done.\"\"Very true, my dear. And now I'll run up and see my little girl, and tell her the good news. You'd better follow me in a couple of minutes.\" This to Cynthia.Molly's delight at seeing her showed itself first in a few happy tears; and then in soft caresses and inarticulate sounds of love. Once or twice she began, \"It is such a pleasure,\" and there she stopped short. But the eloquence of these five words sank deep into Cynthia's heart. She had returned just at the right time, when Molly wanted the gentle fillip of the society of a fresh and yet a familiar person. Cynthia's tact made her talkative or silent, gay or grave, as the varying humour of Molly required. She listened, too, with the semblance, if not the reality, of unwearied interest, to Molly's continual recurrence to all the time of distress and sorrow at Hamley Hall, and to the scenes which had then so deeply impressed themselves upon her susceptible nature. Cynthia instinctively knew that the repetition of all these painful recollections would ease the oppressed memory, which refused to dwell on anything but what had occurred at a time of feverish disturbance of health. So she never interrupted Molly, as Mrs. Gibson had so frequently done, with--\"You told me all that before, my dear. Let us talk of something else;\" or, \"Really I cannot allow you to be always dwelling on painful thoughts. Try and be a little more cheerful. Youth is gay. You are young, and therefore you ought to be gay. That is put in a famous form of speech; I forget exactly what it is called.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Mr. Gibson and his wife discuss Cynthia's foolishness but Mr. Gibson finds it endearing. Mr. Gibson then goes to see his daughter, Molly, who is delighted to see Cynthia. Cynthia is able to provide the companionship and support that Molly needs, listening to her talk about her distress and sorrow at Hamley Hall without interrupting or trying to change the subject. Mrs. Gibson, on the other hand, frequently interrupts Molly and tries to make her be more cheerful\n","------\n","\n","\n","753\n","And last of all, though strongest in regard, most piteously eager in interest, came Squire Hamley himself. When she was at the worst, he rode over every day to hear the smallest detail, facing even Mrs. Gibson (his abomination) if her husband was not at home, to ask and hear, and ask and hear, till the tears were unconsciously stealing down his cheeks. Every resource of his heart, or his house, or his lands was searched and tried, if it could bring a moment's pleasure to her; and whatever it might be that came from him, at her very worst time, it brought out a dim smile upon her face.\n","------\n","Squire Hamley is deeply concerned for someone who is very ill. He visits them every day, even facing someone he dislikes, to inquire about their condition. He tries everything he can to bring them joy, using all his resources. Even at their worst, the person manages to smile when receiving something from him.\n","------\n","\n","\n","754\n","LV.AN ABSENT LOVER RETURNS.And now it was late June; and to Molly's and her father's extreme urgency in pushing, and Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick's affectionate persistency in pulling, Cynthia had yielded, and had gone back to finish her interrupted visit in London, but not before the bruit of her previous sudden return to nurse Molly had told strongly in her favour in the fluctuating opinion of the little town. Her affair with Mr. Preston was thrust into the shade; while every one was speaking of her warm heart. Under the gleam of Molly's recovery everything assumed a rosy hue, as indeed became the time when actual roses were fully in bloom.One morning Mrs. Gibson brought Molly a great basket of flowers, that had been sent from the Hall. Molly still breakfasted in bed, but she had just come down, and was now well enough to arrange the flowers for the drawing-room, and as she did so with these blossoms, she made some comments on each.\"Ah! these white pinks! They were Mrs. Hamley's favourite flower; and so like her! This little bit of sweet briar, it quite scents the room. It has pricked my fingers, but never mind. Oh, mamma, look at this rose! I forget its name, but it is very rare, and grows up in the sheltered corner of the wall, near the mulberry-tree. Roger bought the tree for his mother with his own money when he was quite a boy; he showed it me, and made me notice it.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia has returned to London to finish her interrupted visit, and her previous sudden return to nurse Molly has improved her reputation in the town. Molly receives a basket of flowers from the Hall, and as she arranges them, she reminisces about Mrs. Hamley's favorite flower and a rare rose that Roger bought for his mother.\n","------\n","\n","\n","755\n","\"No! Roger! Roger come home!\" said Molly, turning first red, then very white.\"Yes. Oh, I remember you had gone to bed before papa came in, and he was called off early to tiresome Mrs. Beale. Yes, Roger turned up at the Hall the day before yesterday.\"But Molly leaned back against her chair, too faint to do more at the flowers for some time. She had been startled by the suddenness of the news. \"Roger come home!\"It happened that Mr. Gibson was unusually busy on this particular day, and he did not come home till late in the afternoon. But Molly kept her place in the drawing-room all the time, not even going to take her customary siesta, so anxious was she to hear everything about Roger's return, which as yet appeared to her almost incredible. But it was quite natural in reality; the long monotony of her illness had made her lose all count of time. When Roger left England, his idea was to coast round Africa on the eastern side until he reached the Cape; and thence to make what further journey or voyage might seem to him best in pursuit of his scientific objects. To Cape Town all his letters had been addressed of late; and there, two months before, he had received the intelligence of Osborne's death, as well as Cynthia's hasty letter of relinquishment. He did not consider that he was doing wrong in returning to England immediately, and reporting himself to the gentlemen who had sent him out, with a full explanation of the circumstances relating to Osborne's private marriage and sudden death. He offered, and they accepted his offer, to go out again for any time that they might think equivalent to the five months he was yet engaged to them for. They were most of them gentlemen of property, and saw the full importance of proving the marriage of an eldest son, and installing his child as the natural heir to a long-descended estate. This much information, but in a more condensed form, Mr. Gibson gave to Molly, in a very few minutes. She sat up on her sofa, looking very pretty with the flush on her cheeks, and the brightness in her eyes.\n","------\n","Molly is shocked to hear that Roger has returned home. She anxiously waits for her father to come home so she can hear more about Roger's return. Roger had been traveling around Africa for his scientific research but decided to return to England after receiving news of Osborne's death and Cynthia's letter of relinquishment. He reported himself to the gentlemen who had sent him out and offered to go back for the remaining time he was contracted for. Molly is excited and sits up on her sofa, looking pretty\n","------\n","\n","\n","756\n","\"Well! what?\" asked he, playfully.\"Oh! why, such a number of things. I've been waiting all day to ask you all about everything. How is he looking?\"\"If a young man of twenty-four ever does take to growing taller, I should say that he was taller. As it is, I suppose it's only that he looks broader, stronger--more muscular.\"\"Oh! is he changed?\" asked Molly, a little disturbed by this account.\"No, not changed; and yet not the same. He's as brown as a berry for one thing; caught a little of the negro tinge, and a beard as fine and sweeping as my bay-mare's tail.\"\"A beard! But go on, papa. Does he talk as he used to do? I should know his voice amongst ten thousand.\"\"I didn't catch any Hottentot twang, if that's what you mean. Nor did he say, 'Cżsar and Pompey berry much alike, 'specially Pompey,' which is the only specimen of negro language I can remember just at this moment.\"\"And which I never could see the wit of,\" said Mrs. Gibson, who had come into the room after the conversation had begun; and did not understand what it was aiming at. Molly fidgeted; she wanted to go on with her questions and keep her father to definite and matter-of-fact answers, and she knew that when his wife chimed into a conversation, Mr. Gibson was very apt to find out that he must go about some necessary piece of business.\n","------\n","Molly is excited to ask her father about someone named \"he.\" She wants to know how he looks and if he has changed. Her father tells her that he looks taller and more muscular, with a brown complexion and a beard. Molly is concerned about these changes. Her mother interrupts the conversation, causing Molly to become impatient and want to continue asking her father questions.\n","------\n","\n","\n","757\n","\"Oh!\" said Mr. Gibson, \"Roger is evidently putting everything to rights in his firm, quiet way.\"\"'Things to rights.' Why, what's wrong?\" asked Mrs. Gibson quickly. \"The Squire and the French daughter-in-law don't get on well together, I suppose? I am always so glad Cynthia acted with the promptitude she did; it would have been very awkward for her to have been mixed up with all these complications. Poor Roger! to find himself supplanted by a child when he comes home!\"\"You were not in the room, my dear, when I was telling Molly of the reasons for Roger's return; it was to put his brother's child at once into his rightful and legal place. So now, when he finds the work partly done to his hands, he is happy and gratified in proportion.\"\"Then he is not much affected by Cynthia's breaking off her engagement?\" (Mrs. Gibson could afford to call it an \"engagement\" now.) \"I never did give him credit for very deep feelings.\"\"On the contrary, he feels it very acutely. He and I had a long talk about it, yesterday.\"\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson is discussing with Mrs. Gibson about their son Roger and how he is putting things right in his own quiet way. Mrs. Gibson asks what is wrong, suggesting that the Squire and the French daughter-in-law don't get along. Mrs. Gibson is glad that their daughter Cynthia acted promptly and avoided getting involved in any complications. Mr. Gibson explains that Roger returned home to put his brother's child in his rightful place, and now that the work is partly done, Roger is happy\n","------\n","\n","\n","758\n","Molly went on with her questions on other subjects. \"And Mrs. Osborne Hamley? How is she?\"\"Wonderfully brightened up by Roger's presence. I don't think I've ever seen her smile before; but she gives him the sweetest smiles from time to time. They are evidently good friends; and she loses her strange startled look when she speaks to him. I suspect she has been quite aware of the Squire's wish that she should return to France; and has been hard put to it to decide whether to leave her child or not. The idea that she would have to make some such decision came upon her when she was completely shattered by grief and illness, and she hasn't had any one to consult as to her duty until Roger came, upon whom she has evidently firm reliance. He told me something of this himself.\"\"You seem to have had quite a long conversation with him, papa!\"\"Yes. I was going to see old Abraham, when the Squire called to me over the hedge, as I was jogging along. He told me the news; and there was no resisting his invitation to come back and lunch with them. Besides, one gets a great deal of meaning out of Roger's words; it didn't take so very long a time to hear this much.\"\n","------\n","Molly asks about Mrs. Osborne Hamley and learns that she has been brightened up by Roger's presence. Mrs. Osborne Hamley and Roger are good friends, and she seems to rely on him.

She remembered the last time he was in that very room, and the hopes with which he left it; and she fancied that she could see traces of this thought in her father's countenance at his wife's speech.\"I can't tell, my dear. Until he's quite convinced of Cynthia's intentions, it can't be very pleasant for him to come on mere visits of ceremony to the house in which he has known her; but he's one who will always do what he thinks right, whether pleasant or not.\"Mrs. Gibson could hardly wait till her husband had finished his sentence before she testified against a part of it.\"'Convinced of Cynthia's intentions!' I should think she had made them pretty clear! What more does the man want?\"\"He's not as yet convinced that the letter wasn't written in a fit of temporary feeling. I've told him that this was true; although I didn't feel it my place to explain to him the causes of that feeling. He believes that he can induce her to resume the former footing. I don't; and I've told him so; but, of course, he needs the full conviction that she alone can give him.\"\n","------\n","Molly is discussing with her father whether or not a man named Mr. Gibson will come to their house. Molly is doubtful because she remembers the last time Mr. Gibson was there and the hopes he had. Her father explains that Mr. Gibson is waiting to be convinced of Cynthia's intentions before he visits. Mrs. Gibson disagrees and believes Cynthia has already made her intentions clear. Molly's father explains that Mr. Gibson believes he can convince Cynthia to resume their previous relationship, but Molly's father does\n","------\n","\n","\n","760\n","Mr. Gibson's eyes flashed fire. But he kept his lips tight closed; and only said, \"'That man,' indeed!\" quite below his breath.Molly, too, had been damped by an expression or two in her father's speech. \"Mere visits of ceremony!\" Was it so, indeed? A \"mere visit of ceremony!\" Whatever it was, the call was paid before many days were over. That he felt all the awkwardness of his position towards Mrs. Gibson--that he was in reality suffering pain all the time--was but too evident to Molly; but, of course, Mrs. Gibson saw nothing of this in her gratification at the proper respect paid to her by one whose name was in the newspapers that chronicled his return, and about whom already Lord Cumnor and the Towers family had been making inquiry.Molly was sitting in her pretty white invalid's dress, half reading, half dreaming, for the June air was so clear and ambient, the garden so full of bloom, the trees so full of leaf, that reading by the open window was only a pretence at such a time; besides which, Mrs. Gibson continually interrupted her with remarks about the pattern of her worsted work. It was after lunch--orthodox calling time, when Maria ushered in Mr. Roger Hamley. Molly started up; and then stood shyly and quietly in her place while a bronzed, bearded, grave man came into the room, in whom she at first had to seek for the merry boyish face she knew by heart only two years ago. But months in the climates in which Roger had been travelling age as much as years in more temperate regions. And constant thought and anxiety while in daily peril of life deepen the lines of character upon the face. Moreover, the circumstances that had of late affected him personally were not of a nature to make him either buoyant or cheerful. But his voice was the same; that was the first point of the old friend Molly caught, when he addressed her in a tone far softer than he used in speaking conventional politenesses to her stepmother.\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson is upset by something and keeps his feelings to himself. Molly is also affected by her father's speech and is unsure about the nature of a visit that is being discussed. Despite his discomfort, Mr. Gibson pays a visit to Mrs. Gibson, who is pleased by the attention. Molly is sitting by the window, pretending to read, when Mr. Roger Hamley arrives. Molly is surprised by his appearance, as he looks older and more serious than she remembers. However, his voice\n","------\n","\n","\n","761\n","\"Oh! I am quite strong now to what I was. It would be a shame to be ill when everything is in its full summer beauty.\"\"I have heard how deeply we--I am indebted to you--my father can hardly praise you--\"\"Please don't,\" said Molly, the tears coming into her eyes in spite of herself. He seemed to understand her at once; he went on as if speaking to Mrs. Gibson: \"Indeed, my little sister-in-law is never weary of talking about Monsieur le Docteur, as she calls your husband!\"\"I have not had the pleasure of making Mrs. Osborne Hamley's acquaintance yet,\" said Mrs. Gibson, suddenly aware of a duty which might have been expected from her, \"and I must beg you to apologize to her for my remissness. But Molly has been such a care and anxiety to me--for, you know, I look upon her quite as my own child--that I really have not gone anywhere; excepting to the Towers, perhaps I should say, which is just like another home to me. And then I understood that Mrs. Osborne Hamley was thinking of returning to France before long? Still it was very remiss.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Molly is speaking to someone about her improved health and how she doesn't want to be ill when everything is beautiful in the summer. The person she is speaking to mentions how Molly's father praises them and Molly becomes emotional. The person then mentions Molly's sister-in-law, Mrs. Osborne Hamley, and how Molly talks about her husband, Monsieur le Docteur.

But at present nothing is arranged.\" Then, as if glad to have got over his \"visit of ceremony,\" he got up and took leave. When he was at the door he looked back, having, as he thought, a word more to say; but he quite forgot what it was, for he surprised Molly's intent gaze, and sudden confusion at discovery, and went away as soon as he could.\"Poor Osborne was right!\" said he. \"She has grown into delicate fragrant beauty, just as he said she would: or is it the character which has formed her face? Now the next time I enter these doors, it will be to learn my fate!\"Mr. Gibson had told his wife of Roger's desire to have a personal interview with Cynthia, rather with a view to her repeating what he said to her daughter. He did not see any exact necessity for this, it is true; but he thought it might be advisable that she should know all the truth in which she was concerned, and he told his wife this. But she took the affair into her own management, and, although she apparently agreed with Mr. Gibson, she never named the affair to Cynthia; all that she said to her was--\n","------\n","The paragraph is about a man named Roger visiting the Hamley family.

She had refused him once, and he did not know the reason of her refusal, at least one of the reasons. She did not know if she should have taken him if there had been no such person as Roger Hamley in the world. No! Uncle and aunt Kirkpatrick had never heard anything about Roger's offer,--nor had her cousins. She had always declared her wish to keep it a secret, and she had not mentioned it to any one, whatever other people might have done.\" Underneath this light and careless vein there were other feelings; but Mrs. Gibson was not one to probe beneath the surface. She had set her heart on Mr. Henderson's marrying Cynthia very early in their acquaintance; and to know, firstly, that the same wish had entered into his head, and that Roger's attachment to Cynthia, with its consequences, had been the obstacle; and secondly, that Cynthia herself with all the opportunities of propinquity which she had lately had, had failed to provoke a repetition of the offer,--was, as Mrs. Gibson said, \"enough to provoke a saint.\" All the rest of the day she alluded to Cynthia as a disappointing and ungrateful daughter; Molly could not make out why, and resented it for Cynthia, until the latter said, bitterly, \"Never mind, Molly. Mamma is only vexed because Mr.--because I have not come back an engaged young lady.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia has written a letter that she hopes will not disturb or make someone uncomfortable.

Cynthia, I will speak,\" said Molly, all crimson with indignation, and pushing away Cynthia's restraining hand. \"I am sure papa does not feel, and does not mind, any expense he incurs about his daughters. And I know quite well that he does not wish us to marry, unless--\" She faltered and stopped.\"Unless what?\" said Mrs. Gibson, half-mocking.\"Unless we love some one very dearly indeed,\" said Molly, in a low, firm tone.\"Well, after this tirade--really rather indelicate, I must say--I have done. I will neither help nor hinder any love-affairs of you two young ladies. In my days we were glad of the advice of our elders.\" And she left the room to put into fulfilment an idea which had just struck her: to write a confidential letter to Mrs. Kirkpatrick, giving her her version of Cynthia's \"unfortunate entanglement,\" and \"delicate sense of honour,\" and hints of her entire indifference to all the masculine portion of the world, Mr. Henderson being dexterously excluded from the category.\n","------\n","Cynthia is feeling tired and unable to see the ingratitude that her mother is accusing her of. Her mother argues that they are doing everything they can for Cynthia, including dressing her well and sending her to London, but Cynthia is not relieving them of the expense.

She had written and posted her letter, and the next thing was to keep Cynthia in what she called a reasonable state, or, in other words, to try and cajole her into docility. But it was so much labour lost. Cynthia had already received a letter from Mr. Henderson before she came down to breakfast,--a declaration of love, a proposal of marriage as clear as words could make it; together with an intimation that, unable to wait for the slow delays of the post, he was going to follow her down to Hollingford, and would arrive at the same time that she had done herself on the previous day. Cynthia said nothing about this letter to any one. She came late into the breakfast-room, after Mr. and Mrs. Gibson had finished the actual business of the meal; but her unpunctuality was quite accounted for by the fact that she had been travelling all the night before. Molly was not as yet strong enough to get up so early. Cynthia hardly spoke, and did not touch her food.

Titles as well as fortune!\"Cynthia was almost too much absorbed in her own reflections to reply, but she did say,--\"Hundreds of briefless barristers.

But it did not affect Mrs. Gibson, who affixed even less truth to it than there really was. The idea of a residence in a new, strange country, among new, strange people, was not without allurement to Cynthia.\"You always look nice, dear; but don't you think you had better put on that pretty lilac silk?\"\"I shall not vary a thread or a shred from what I have got on now.\"\"You dear, wilful creature! you know you always look lovely in whatever you put on.\" So, kissing her daughter, Mrs. Gibson left the room, intent on the lunch which should impress Mr. Henderson at once with an idea of family refinement.Cynthia went upstairs to Molly; she was inclined to tell her about Mr. Henderson, but she found it impossible to introduce the subject naturally, so she left it to time to reveal the future as gradually as it might. Molly was tired with a bad night; and her father, in his flying visit to his darling before going out, had advised her to stay upstairs for the greater part of the morning, and to keep quiet in her own room till after her early dinner, so Time had not a fair chance of telling her what he had in store in his budget. Mrs. Gibson sent an apology to Molly for not paying her her usual morning visit, and told Cynthia to give Mr. Henderson's probable coming as a reason for her occupation downstairs. But Cynthia did no such thing. She kissed Molly, and sate silently by her, holding her hand; till at length she jumped up, and said, \"You shall be left alone now, little one. I want you to be very well and very bright this afternoon: so rest now.\" And Cynthia left her, and went to her own room, locked the door, and began to think.\n","------\n","Cynthia is being pressured by her mother to accept a man named Mr. Henderson, but she refuses to do so just to make her mother happy.

Miss Gibson is there, I know.\"So he went upstairs, all his nerves on the strain for the coming interview with Cynthia. It was either a relief or a disappointment, he was not sure which, to find only Molly in the room:--Molly, half lying on the couch in the bow-window which commanded the garden; draped in soft white drapery, very white herself, and a laced half-handkerchief tied over her head to save her from any ill effects of the air that blew in through the open window.

Send out word to her. Don't let her be interrupted.\"And Roger ran downstairs at full speed, and Molly heard the passionate clang of the outer door. He had hardly left the house before Cynthia entered the room, pale and resolute.\"Where is he?\" she said, looking around, as if he might yet be hidden.\"Gone!\" said Molly, very faint.\"Gone. Oh, what a relief! It seems to be my fate never to be off with the old lover before I am on with the new, and yet I did write as decidedly as I could. Why, Molly, what's the matter?\" for now Molly had fainted away utterly. Cynthia flew to the bell, summoned Maria, water, salts, wine, anything; and as soon as Molly, gasping and miserable, became conscious again, she wrote a little pencil-note to Mr. Henderson, bidding him return to the \"George,\" whence he had come in the morning, and saying that if he obeyed her at once, he might be allowed to call again in the evening, otherwise she would not see him till the next day. This she sent down by Maria, and the unlucky man never believed but that it was Miss Gibson's sudden indisposition in the first instance that had deprived him of his charmer's company. He comforted himself for the long solitary afternoon by writing to tell all his friends of his happiness, and amongst them uncle and aunt Kirkpatrick, who received his letter by the same post as that discreet epistle of Mrs. Gibson's, which she had carefully arranged to reveal as much as she wished, and no more.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Roger arrives at a house to speak to Cynthia, but is informed by Molly that she is now engaged to Mr. Henderson.

Besides, I've no more time to waste; and there's your smart young man coming here in all haste.\"Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick sent all manner of congratulations; and Mrs. Gibson, in a private letter, assured Mrs. Kirkpatrick that her ill-timed confidence about Roger should be considered as quite private. For as soon as Mr. Henderson had made his appearance in Hollingford, she had written a second letter, entreating them not to allude to anything she might have said in her first; which she said was written in such excitement on discovering the real state of her daughter's affections, that she had hardly known what she had said, and had exaggerated some things, and misunderstood others: all that she did know now was, that Mr. Henderson had just proposed to Cynthia, and was accepted, and that they were as happy as the day was long, and (\"excuse the vanity of a mother,\") made a most lovely couple. So Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick wrote back an equally agreeable letter, praising Mr. Henderson, admiring Cynthia, and generally congratulatory; insisting into the bargain that the marriage should take place from their house in Hyde Park Street, and that Mr. and Mrs. Gibson and Molly should all come up and pay them a visit. There was a little postscript at the end. \"Surely you do not mean the famous traveller, Hamley, about whose discoveries all our scientific men are so much excited. You speak of him as a young Hamley, who went to Africa. Answer this question, pray, for Helen is most anxious to know.\" This P.S. being in Helen's handwriting. In her exultation at the general success of everything, and desire for sympathy, Mrs. Gibson read parts of this letter to Molly; the postscript among the rest. It made a deeper impression on Molly than even the proposed kindness of the visit to London.\n","------\n","Cynthia is grateful to someone for paying her expenses to Russia and back. She kisses the person and calls them kind. They joke about the person's shirt collars and mention Mr. Henderson. Cynthia and Mr. Henderson are engaged and Mrs. Gibson writes a letter to Cynthia's parents to inform them. The parents congratulate them and invite them to their house in Hyde Park Street. There is a postscript asking about a famous traveler named Hamley. Mrs. Gibson reads parts of the letter to Molly\n","------\n","\n","\n","777\n","LVII.BRIDAL VISITS AND ADIEUX.The whole town of Hollingford came to congratulate and inquire into particulars. Some indeed--Mrs. Goodenough at the head of this class of malcontents--thought that they were defrauded of their right to a fine show by Cynthia's being married in London. Even Lady Cumnor was moved into action. She, who had hardly ever paid calls \"out of her own sphere,\" who had only once been to see \"Clare\" in her own house--she came to congratulate after her fashion. Maria had only just time to run up into the drawing-room one morning, and say,--\"Please, ma'am, the great carriage from the Towers is coming up to the gate, and my lady the Countess is sitting inside.\" It was but eleven o'clock, and Mrs. Gibson would have been indignant at any commoner who had ventured to call at such an untimely hour, but in the case of the Peerage the rules of domestic morality were relaxed.The family \"stood at arms,\" as it were, till Lady Cumnor appeared in the drawing-room; and then she had to be settled in the best chair, and the light adjusted before anything like conversation began. She was the first to speak; and Lady Harriet, who had begun a few words to Molly, dropped into silence.\n","------\n","The whole town of Hollingford comes to congratulate and inquire about Cynthia's wedding. Some people, like Mrs. Goodenough, are upset that the wedding took place in London and they were not able to witness a grand show. Even Lady Cumnor, who rarely pays calls outside of her social circle, comes to congratulate in her own way. Maria informs Mrs. Gibson that Lady Cumnor's carriage is arriving, and despite the early hour, the family prepares to receive her. Lady\n","------\n","\n","\n","778\n","\"He is a barrister,\" put in Cynthia, unable to restrain herself any longer. \"Barrister-at-law.\"\"Ah, yes. Attorney-at-law. Barrister-at-law. I understand without your speaking so loud, my dear. What was I going to say before you interrupted me? When you have been a little in society you will find that it is reckoned bad manners to interrupt. I had a great deal more to say to you, and you have put it all out of my head. There was something else your father wanted me to ask--what was it, Harriet?\"\"I suppose you mean about Mr. Hamley?\"\"Oh, yes! we are intending to have the house full of Lord Hollingford's friends next month, and Lord Cumnor is particularly anxious to secure Mr. Hamley.\"\"The Squire?\" asked Mrs. Gibson in some surprise. Lady Cumnor bowed slightly, as much as to say, \"If you did not interrupt me I should explain.\"\"The famous traveller--the scientific Mr. Hamley, I mean. I imagine he is son to the Squire. Lord Hollingford knows him well; but when we asked him before, he declined coming, and assigned no reason.\"\n","------\n","Cynthia interrupts a conversation to mention that someone is a barrister. Lady Cumnor is annoyed by the interruption and forgets what she was going to say. Mrs. Gibson asks about Mr. Hamley, and Lady Cumnor explains that they want him to come to their house, but he has declined in the past without giving a reason.\n","------\n","\n","\n","779\n","\"Now this time we are particularly anxious to secure him, and my son Lord Hollingford will not return to England until the very week before the Duke of Atherstone is coming to us. I believe Mr. Gibson is very intimate with Mr. Hamley; do you think he could induce him to favour us with his company?\"And this from the proud Lady Cumnor; and the object of it Roger Hamley, whom she had all but turned out of her drawing-room two years ago for calling at an untimely hour; and whom Cynthia had turned out of her heart. Mrs. Gibson was surprised, and could only murmur out that she was sure Mr. Gibson would do all that her ladyship wished.\"Thank you. You know me well enough to be aware that I am not the person, nor is the Towers the house, to go about soliciting guests. But in this instance I bend my head; high rank should always be the first to honour those who have distinguished themselves by art or science.\"\"Besides, mamma,\" said Lady Harriet, \"papa was saying that the Hamleys have been on their land since before the Conquest; while we only came into the county a century ago; and there is a tale that the first Cumnor began his fortune through selling tobacco in King James's reign.\"\n","------\n","Lady Cumnor is anxious to secure the presence of Roger Hamley, who she had previously turned away from her home, for an upcoming visit from the Duke of Atherstone. She asks Mrs. Gibson if her husband, who is friends with Mr. Hamley, could convince him to come. Mrs. Gibson agrees to ask her husband. Lady Harriet suggests that the Hamleys, who have been on their land for centuries, are more deserving of honor than the Cumnors, who\n","------\n","\n","\n","780\n","Nevertheless she prepared a handsome present for the bride: a Bible and a Prayer-book bound in velvet with silver-clasps; and also a collection of household account-books, at the beginning of which Lady Cumnor wrote down with her own hand the proper weekly allowance of bread, butter, eggs, meat, and groceries per head, with the London prices of the articles, so that the most inexperienced housekeeper might ascertain whether her expenditure exceeded her means, as she expressed herself in the note which she sent with the handsome, dull present.\"If you are driving into Hollingford, Harriet, perhaps you will take these books to Miss Kirkpatrick,\" said Lady Cumnor, after she had sealed her note with all the straightness and correctness befitting a countess of her immaculate character. \"I understand they are all going up to London to-morrow for this wedding, in spite of what I said to Clare of the duty of being married in one's own parish-church. She told me at the time that she entirely agreed with me, but that her husband had such a strong wish for a visit to London, that she did not know how she could oppose him consistently with her wifely duty. I advised her to repeat to him my reasons for thinking that they would be ill-advised to have the marriage in town; but I am afraid she has been overruled. That was her one great fault when she lived with us; she was always so yielding, and never knew how to say 'No.'\"\n","------\n","Lady Cumnor prepares a gift for the bride, which includes a Bible, a Prayer-book, and household account-books. She also writes down the proper weekly allowance for various items and their prices. Lady Cumnor asks Harriet to deliver the gift to Miss Kirkpatrick, who is getting married in London despite Lady Cumnor's advice to have the wedding in their own parish. Lady Cumnor criticizes Miss Kirkpatrick for being too yielding and unable to say no.\n","------\n","\n","\n","781\n","\"To be sure I should, my dear. I like everybody to have an opinion of their own; only when my opinions are based on thought and experience, which few people have had equal opportunities of acquiring, I think it is but proper deference in others to allow themselves to be convinced. In fact, I think it is only obstinacy which keeps them from acknowledging that they are. I am not a despot, I hope?\" she asked, with some anxiety.\"If you are, dear mamma,\" said Lady Harriet, kissing the stern uplifted face very fondly, \"I like a despotism better than a republic, and I must be very despotic over my ponies, for it's already getting very late for my drive round by Ash-holt.\"But when she arrived at the Gibsons', she was detained so long there by the state of the family, that she had to give up her going to Ash-holt.Molly was sitting in the drawing-room pale and trembling, and keeping herself quiet only by a strong effort. She was the only person there when Lady Harriet entered: the room was all in disorder, strewed with presents and paper, and pasteboard boxes, and half-displayed articles of finery.\n","------\n","Lady Harriet is discussing her opinions with her mother, expressing that she believes others should defer to her opinions because they are based on thought and experience. Lady Harriet's mother is concerned that she may be acting like a despot, but Lady Harriet reassures her that she prefers a despotism over a republic. Lady Harriet then goes to visit the Gibsons, where she finds Molly in a state of distress in a messy room filled with presents and finery.\n","------\n","\n","\n","782\n","\"Oh, no! that's all right. But I have caught a fresh cold, and papa says he thinks I had better not go to the wedding.\"\"Poor little one! And it's the first visit to London too!\"\"Yes. But what I most care for is the not being with Cynthia to the last; and then, papa\"--she stopped, for she could hardly go on without open crying, and she did not want to do that. Then she cleared her voice. \"Papa,\" she continued, \"has so looked forward to this holiday,--and seeing--and--, and going--oh! I can't tell you where; but he has quite a list of people and sights to be seen,--and now he says he should not be comfortable to leave me all alone for more than three days,--two for travelling, and one for the wedding.\" Just then Mrs. Gibson came in, ruffled too after her fashion, though the presence of Lady Harriet was wonderfully smoothing.\"My dear Lady Harriet--how kind of you! Ah, yes, I see this poor unfortunate child has been telling you of her ill-luck; just when everything was going on so beautifully; I'm sure it was that open window at your back, Molly,--you know you would persist that it could do you no harm, and now you see the mischief! I'm sure I shan't be able to enjoy myself--and at my only child's wedding too--without you; for I can't think of leaving you without Maria. I would rather sacrifice anything myself than think of you, uncared for, and dismal at home.\"\n","------\n","The protagonist has caught a cold and her father doesn't want her to go to a wedding in London. She is upset because she won't be able to be with her friend Cynthia and her father had been looking forward to the holiday. Mrs. Gibson, the protagonist's mother, is also upset and doesn't want to leave her alone. Lady Harriet is present and tries to comfort everyone.\n","------\n","\n","\n","783\n","\"No. I don't think she is,\" said Mrs. Gibson, with happy disregard of the chronology of events, \"or she would not have sate with her back to an open window the day before yesterday, when I told her not. But it can't be helped now. Papa too--but it is my duty to make the best of everything, and look at the cheerful side of life. I wish I could persuade her to do the same\" (turning and addressing Lady Harriet). \"But, you see, it is a great mortification to a girl of her age to lose her first visit to London.\"\"It is not that,\" began Molly; but Lady Harriet made her a little sign to be silent while she herself spoke.\"Now, Clare! you and I can manage it all, I think, if you will but help me in a plan I've got in my head. Mr. Gibson shall stay as long as ever he can in London; and Molly shall be well cared for, and have some change of air and scene too, which is really what she needs as much as anything, in my poor opinion. I can't spirit her to the wedding and give her a sight of London; but I can carry her off to the Towers, and nurse her myself; and send daily bulletins up to London, so that Mr. Gibson may feel quite at ease, and stay with you as long as you like. What do you say to it, Clare?\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson is discussing the behavior of a girl, possibly her daughter, who sat with her back to an open window despite being told not to. She expresses her desire to make the best of the situation and wishes to persuade the girl to do the same. Lady Harriet suggests a plan where Mr. Gibson stays in London while the girl, Molly, is taken care of and given a change of air and scene at the Towers. This plan would allow Mr. Gibson to stay in London for as\n","------\n","\n","\n","784\n","\"Nobody asked you for your opinion, little one. If we wise elders decide that you are to go, you must submit in silence.\"Meanwhile Mrs. Gibson was rapidly balancing advantages and disadvantages. Amongst the latter, jealousy came in predominant. Amongst the former,--it would sound well; Maria could then accompany Cynthia and herself as \"their maid;\" Mr. Gibson would stay longer with her, and it was always desirable to have a man at her beck and call in such a place as London; besides that, this identical man was gentlemanly and good-looking, and a favourite with her prosperous brother-in-law. The \"ayes\" had it.\"What a charming plan! I cannot think of anything kinder or pleasanter for this poor darling. Only--what will Lady Cumnor say? I am modest for my family as much as for myself. She won't--\"\"You know mamma's sense of hospitality is never more gratified than when the house is quite full; and papa is just like her.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Gibson is considering the advantages and disadvantages of a plan. The plan involves Maria accompanying Cynthia and herself as their maid, with Mr. Gibson staying longer with Mrs. Gibson. Mrs. Gibson believes it would be desirable to have a man at her beck and call in London, especially since he is gentlemanly and good-looking and a favorite of her brother-in-law.\n","------\n","\n","\n","785\n","\"She shall have the south pink room, opening out of mine by one door, you remember; and the dressing-room shall be made into a cosy little sitting-room for her, in case she likes to be by herself. Parkes shall attend upon her, and I'm sure Mr. Gibson must know Parkes's powers as a nurse by this time. We shall have all manner of agreeable people in the house to amuse her downstairs; and when she has got rid of this access of cold, I will drive her out every day, and write daily bulletins, as I said. Pray tell Mr. Gibson all that, and let it be considered as settled. I will come for her in the close carriage to-morrow, at eleven. And now may I see the lovely bride-elect, and give her mamma's present, and my own good wishes?\"So Cynthia came in, and demurely received the very proper present, and the equally correct congratulations, without testifying any very great delight or gratitude at either; for she was quite quick enough to detect there was no great afflux of affection accompanying either. But when she heard her mother quickly recapitulating all the details of the plan for Molly, Cynthia's eyes did sparkle with gladness; and almost to Lady Harriet's surprise, she thanked her as if she had conferred a personal favour upon her, Cynthia. Lady Harriet saw, too, that in a very quiet way, she had taken Molly's hand, and was holding it all the time, as if loth to think of their approaching separation--somehow, she and Lady Harriet were brought nearer together by this little action than they had ever been before.\n","------\n","Cynthia is being given a room in the house and a nurse named Parkes to take care of her. There will be people in the house to keep her entertained and she will be driven out every day once she gets over her cold. Lady Harriet wants to see Cynthia and give her a present and good wishes. Cynthia receives the present and congratulations without much enthusiasm, but is happy when she hears about the plan for Molly.

All the morning Cynthia had been with her in her room, attending to the arrangement of Molly's clothes, instructing her what to wear with what, and rejoicing over the pretty smartnesses, which, having been prepared for her as bridesmaid, were now to serve as adornments for her visit to the Towers. Both Molly and Cynthia spoke about dress as if it was the very object of their lives; for each dreaded the introduction of more serious subjects; Cynthia more for Molly than herself. Only when the carriage was announced, and Molly was preparing to go downstairs, Cynthia said,--\"I am not going to thank you, Molly, or to tell you how I love you.\"\"Don't,\" said Molly, \"I can't bear it.\"\"Only you know you are to be my first visitor, and if you wear brown ribbons to a green gown, I'll turn you out of the house!\" So they parted. Mr. Gibson was there in the hall to hand Molly in. He had ridden hard; and was now giving her two or three last injunctions as to her health.\n","------\n","Molly is preparing to leave her home and travel to London for a wedding. Her sister Cynthia helps her pack and they discuss what clothes she should wear. They avoid talking about more serious subjects. Molly's father is there to see her off and gives her some last-minute advice about her health.\n","------\n","\n","\n","787\n","They drove away, and until they were out of sight of the house, Molly had enough to do to keep returning the kisses of the hand wafted to her by her stepmother out of the drawing-room window, while at the same time her eyes were fixed on a white handkerchief fluttering out of the attic from which she herself had watched Roger's departure nearly two years before. What changes time had brought!When Molly arrived at the Towers she was convoyed into Lady Cumnor's presence by Lady Harriet. It was a mark of respect to the lady of the house, which the latter knew that her mother would expect; but she was anxious to get it over, and take Molly up into the room which she had been so busy arranging for her. Lady Cumnor was, however, very kind, if not positively gracious.\"You are Lady Harriet's visitor, my dear,\" said she, \"and I hope she will take good care of you. If not, come and complain of her to me.\" It was as near an approach to a joke as Lady Cumnor ever perpetrated, and from it Lady Harriet knew that her mother was pleased by Molly's manners and appearance.\n","------\n","Molly is leaving her house with someone and waves goodbye to her stepmother. She notices a handkerchief in the attic that reminds her of when Roger left two years ago. Molly arrives at the Towers and is taken to Lady Cumnor's presence by Lady Harriet. Lady Cumnor is kind and jokes with Molly, indicating that she is pleased with Molly's manners and appearance.\n","------\n","\n","\n","788\n","Molly was only too glad to allow Lady Harriet to decide everything for her. It had begun to rain, and was altogether a gloomy day for August; and there was a small fire of scented wood burning cheerfully in the sitting-room appropriated to her. High up, it commanded a wide and pleasant view over the park, and from it could be seen the spire of Hollingford Church, which gave Molly a pleasant idea of neighbourhood to home. She was left alone, lying on the sofa--books near her, wood crackling and blazing, wafts of wind bringing the beating rain against the window, and so enhancing the sense of indoor comfort by the outdoor contrast. Parkes was unpacking for her. Lady Harriet had introduced Parkes to Molly by saying, \"Now, Molly, this is Mrs. Parkes, the only person I am ever afraid of. She scolds me if I dirty myself with my paints, just as if I was a little child; and she makes me go to bed when I want to sit up,\"--Parkes was smiling grimly all the time;--\"so to get rid of her tyranny I give her you as victim. Parkes, rule over Miss Gibson with a rod of iron; make her eat and drink, and rest and sleep, and dress as you think wisest and best.\"\n","------\n","Molly is happy to let Lady Harriet make all the decisions for her. It is a gloomy day in August and Molly is in a cozy sitting room with a fire burning. She can see the spire of Hollingford Church from the window, which makes her feel connected to home. Molly is alone on the sofa with books nearby while Parkes unpacks for her. Lady Harriet introduces Parkes as someone who scolds her and makes her go to bed, so she is giving\n","------\n","\n","\n","789\n","Parkes had begun her reign by putting Molly on the sofa, and saying, \"If you will give me your keys, Miss, I will unpack your things, and let you know when it is time for me to arrange your hair, preparatory to luncheon.\" For if Lady Harriet used familiar colloquialisms from time to time, she certainly had not learnt it from Parkes, who piqued herself on the correctness of her language.When Molly went down to lunch she found \"cousin Charles,\" with his aunt, Lady Cumnor. He was a certain Sir Charles Morton, the son of Lady Cumnor's only sister: a plain, sandy-haired man of thirty-five or so; immensely rich, very sensible, awkward, and reserved. He had had a chronic attachment, of many years' standing, to his cousin, Lady Harriet, who did not care for him in the least, although it was the marriage very earnestly desired for her by her mother. Lady Harriet was, however, on friendly terms with him, ordered him about, and told him what to do, and what to leave undone, without having even a doubt as to the willingness of his obedience. She had given him his cue about Molly.\n","------\n","Molly arrives at Parkes' house and is greeted by Parkes, who offers to unpack her things and arrange her hair before lunch. Molly then goes downstairs to have lunch with her cousin Charles and his aunt, Lady Cumnor. Charles is in love with Molly's cousin, Lady Harriet, but she does not reciprocate his feelings. Despite this, Lady Harriet still orders Charles around and tells him what to do. She has given him instructions regarding Molly.\n","------\n","\n","\n","790\n","So Sir Charles began this day at luncheon by taking Molly under his quiet protection. He did not say much to her; but what he did say was thoroughly friendly and sympathetic; and Molly began, as he and Lady Harriet intended that she should, to have a kind of pleasant reliance upon him. Then in the evening while the rest of the family were at dinner--after Molly's tea and hour of quiet repose, Parkes came and dressed her in some of the new clothes prepared for the Kirkpatrick visit, and did her hair in some new and pretty way, so that when Molly looked at herself in the cheval-glass, she scarcely knew the elegant reflection to be that of herself. She was fetched down by Lady Harriet into the great long formidable drawing-room, which as an interminable place of pacing, had haunted her dreams ever since her childhood. At the further end sat Lady Cumnor at her tapestry work; the light of fire and candle seemed all concentrated on that one bright part where presently Lady Harriet made tea, and Lord Cumnor went to sleep, and Sir Charles read passages aloud from the _Edinburgh Review_ to the three ladies at their work.\n","------\n","Sir Charles takes Molly under his protection and speaks to her in a friendly and sympathetic manner. Later, Molly is dressed in new clothes and her hair is styled differently. She is then brought into a large drawing-room where Lady Cumnor is working on tapestry. Lady Harriet makes tea, Lord Cumnor falls asleep, and Sir Charles reads aloud from the Edinburgh Review to the three ladies.\n","------\n","\n","\n","791\n","When Molly went to bed she was constrained to admit that staying at the Towers as a visitor was rather pleasant than otherwise; and she tried to reconcile old impressions with new ones, until she fell asleep. There was another comparatively quiet day before the expected guests began to arrive in the evening. Lady Harriet took Molly a drive in her little pony-carriage; and for the first time for many weeks Molly began to feel the delightful spring of returning health; the dance of youthful spirits in the fresh air cleared by the previous day's rain.\n","------\n","Molly is staying at the Towers as a visitor and finds it pleasant. She tries to reconcile her old impressions with the new ones before falling asleep. The next day, Molly goes on a drive with Lady Harriet and starts to feel healthier and more energetic due to the fresh air.\n","------\n","\n","\n","792\n","LVIII.REVIVING HOPES AND BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS.\"If you can without fatigue, dear, do come down to dinner to-day; you'll then see the people one by one as they appear, instead of having to encounter a crowd of strangers. Hollingford will be here too. I hope you'll find it pleasant.\"So Molly made her appearance at dinner that day; and got to know, by sight at least, some of the most distinguished of the visitors at the Towers. The next day was Thursday, Cynthia's wedding-day; bright and fine in the country, whatever it might be in London. And there were several letters from the home-people awaiting Molly when she came downstairs to the late breakfast. For, every day, every hour, she was gaining strength and health, and she was unwilling to continue her invalid habits any longer than was necessary. She looked so much better that Sir Charles noticed it to Lady Harriet; and several of the visitors spoke of her this morning as a very pretty, lady-like, and graceful girl. This was Thursday; on Friday, as Lady Harriet had told her, some visitors from the more immediate neighbourhood were expected to stay over the Sunday; but she had not mentioned their names, and when Molly went down into the drawing-room before dinner, she was almost startled by perceiving Roger Hamley in the centre of a group of gentlemen, who were all talking together eagerly, and, as it seemed to her, making him the object of their attention. He made a hitch in his conversation, lost the precise meaning of a question addressed to him, answered it rather hastily, and made his way to where Molly was sitting, a little behind Lady Harriet. He had heard that she was staying at the Towers, but he was almost as much surprised by hers, as she was by his unexpected appearance, for he had only seen her once or twice since his return from Africa, and then in the guise of an invalid. Now in her pretty evening dress, with her hair beautifully dressed, her delicate complexion flushed a little with timidity, yet her movements and manners bespeaking quiet ease, Roger hardly recognized her, although he acknowledged her identity. He began to feel that admiring deference which most young men experience when conversing with a very pretty girl: a sort of desire to obtain her good opinion in a manner very different to his old familiar friendliness. He was annoyed when Sir Charles, whose especial charge she still was, came up to take her in to dinner. He could not quite understand the smile of mutual intelligence that passed between the two, each being aware of Lady Harriet's plan of sheltering Molly from the necessity of talking, and acting in conformity with her wishes as much as with their own. Roger found himself puzzling, and watching them from time to time during dinner. Again in the evening he sought her out, but found her again pre-occupied with one of the young men staying in the house, who had had the advantage of two days of mutual interest, and acquaintance with the daily events and jokes and anxieties of the family circle. Molly could not help wishing to break off all this trivial talk and to make room for Roger: she had so much to ask him about everything at the Hall; he was, and had been such a stranger to them all for these last two months, and more. But though each wanted to speak to the other more than to any one else in the room, it so happened that everything seemed to conspire to prevent it. Lord Hollingford carried off Roger to the cluster of middle-aged men; he was wanted to give his opinion upon some scientific subject. Mr. Ernulphus Watson, the young man referred to above, kept his place by Molly, as the prettiest girl in the room, and almost dazed her by his never-ceasing flow of clever small-talk. She looked so tired and pale at last that the ever-watchful Lady Harriet sent Sir Charles to the rescue, and after a few words with Lady Harriet, Roger saw Molly quietly leave the room; and a sentence or two which he heard Lady Harriet address to her cousin made him know that it was for the night. Those sentences might bear another interpretation than the obvious one.\n","------\n","Molly attends dinner at the Towers and gets to know some of the distinguished visitors. She is gaining strength and health and is no longer an invalid. Molly is surprised to see Roger Hamley at the Towers and notices that he is the center of attention. Roger is impressed by Molly's appearance and wants to impress her. However, they are constantly interrupted and unable to have a proper conversation. Molly eventually leaves the room, and Roger overhears Lady Harriet saying something that could have multiple interpretations.\n","------\n","\n","\n","793\n","Why was Molly in Sir Charles's charge? why? Then Roger remembered many little things that might serve to confirm the fancy he had got into his head; and he went to bed puzzled and annoyed. It seemed to him such an incongruous, hastily-got-up sort of engagement, if engagement it really was. On Saturday they were more fortunate: they had a long _tÉte-ł-tÉte_ in the most public place in the house--on a sofa in the hall where Molly was resting at Lady Harriet's command before going upstairs after a walk. Roger was passing through, and saw her, and came to her. Standing before her, and making pretence of playing with the gold-fish in a great marble basin close at hand,--\"I was very unlucky,\" said he. \"I wanted to get near you last night, but it was quite impossible. You were so busy talking to Mr. Watson, until Sir Charles Morton came and carried you off--with such an air of authority! Have you known him long?\"Now this was not at all the manner in which Roger had pre-determined that he would speak of Sir Charles to Molly; but the words came out in spite of himself.\n","------\n","Roger is puzzled and annoyed by Molly being in Sir Charles's charge. He remembers little things that confirm his suspicion and questions the nature of their engagement. On Saturday, Roger sees Molly in the hall and approaches her. He mentions that he wanted to be near her the previous night but couldn't because she was busy talking to Mr. Watson until Sir Charles came and took her away. Roger asks Molly how long she has known Sir Charles, even though this was not how he had planned to bring up the\n","------\n","\n","\n","794\n","\"Oh! he is not handsome; but I believe he is a very sensible man.\"\"Yes! I should think so. He is so silent though, that I can hardly judge.\"\"He bears a very high character in the county,\" said Roger, willing now to give him his full due.Molly stood up.\"I must go upstairs,\" she said; \"I only sate down here for a minute or two because Lady Harriet bade me.\"\"Stop a little longer,\" said he. \"This is really the pleasantest place; this basin of water-lilies gives one the idea, if not the sensation, of coolness; besides--it seems so long since I saw you, and I have a message from my father to give you. He is very angry with you.\"\"Angry with me?\" said Molly in surprise.\"Yes! He heard that you had come here for change of air; and he was offended that you hadn't come to us--to the Hall, instead. He said that you should have remembered old friends!\"Molly took all this quite gravely, and did not at first notice the smile on his face.\"Oh!

Roger became annoyed at her so constantly conjecturing what he must be feeling on the subject of Cynthia's marriage. With sympathetic perception she had discerned that the idea must give him pain; and perhaps she also knew that he would dislike to show the pain; but she had not the presence of mind or ready wit to give a skilful turn to the conversation. All this annoyed Roger, he could hardly tell why. He determined to take the metaphorical bull by the horns. Until that was done, his footing with Molly would always be insecure; as it always is between two friends, who mutually avoid a subject to which their thoughts perpetually recur.\n","------\n","Molly is hesitant to go from one house to another in a fancy manner, as it goes against her simple lifestyle.

AimÄe is shy and awkward with my father, and he has never taken quite kindly to her,--yet I know they would like and value each other, if some one could but bring them together,--and it would be such a comfort to me if this could take place before I have to leave.\"\"To leave--are you going away again?\"\"Yes. Have you not heard? I didn't complete my engagement. I'm going again in September for six months.\"\"I remember. But somehow I fancied--you seemed to have settled down into the old ways at the Hall.\"\"So my father appears to think.

She had gained health, she had had pleasure, the faint fragrance of a new and unacknowledged hope had stolen into her life. No wonder that Mr. Gibson was struck with the improvement in her looks, and Mrs. Gibson impressed with her increased grace.\"Ah, Molly,\" said she, \"it's really wonderful to see what a little good society will do for a girl.

There is something quite different about you--a _je ne sais quoi_--that would tell me at once that you have been mingling with the aristocracy. With all her charms, it was what my darling Cynthia wanted; not that Mr. Henderson thought so, for a more devoted lover can hardly be conceived. He absolutely bought her a parure of diamonds. I was obliged to say to him that I had studied to preserve her simplicity of taste, and that he must not corrupt her with too much luxury. But I was rather disappointed at their going off without a maid. It was the one blemish in the arrangements--the spot in the sun.

So Miss Brownings came to hear all the details of the wedding from Mrs. Gibson, and the history of Molly's visit at the Towers as well. But Mrs. Gibson did not like this divided interest, and some of her old jealousy of Molly's intimacy at the Towers had returned.\"Now, Molly,\" said Miss Browning, \"let us hear how you behaved among the great folks. You must not be set up with all their attention; remember that they pay it to you for your good father's sake.\"\"Molly is, I think, quite aware,\" put in Mrs. Gibson, in her most soft and languid tone, \"that she owes her privilege of visiting at such a house to Lady Cumnor's kind desire to set my mind quite at liberty at the time of Cynthia's marriage.

She had to tell it all with a mental squint; the surest way to spoil a narration. She was also subject to Mrs. Gibson's perpetual corrections of little statements which she knew to be facts. But what vexed her most of all was Mrs. Gibson's last speech before the Miss Brownings left.\"Molly has fallen into rambling ways with this visit of hers, of which she makes so much, as if nobody had ever been in a great house but herself. She is going to Hamley Hall next week,--getting quite dissipated, in fact.\"Yet to Mrs. Goodenough, the next caller on the same errand of congratulation, Mrs. Gibson's tone was quite different. There had always been a tacit antagonism between the two, and the conversation now ran as follows:--\n","------\n","Molly is recounting her visit to a great house to Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe. However, Molly is aware of her stepmother, Mrs. Gibson, listening critically and correcting her statements. Mrs. Gibson then makes a snide comment about Molly's visit, calling her \"dissipated.\" Later, when Mrs. Goodenough visits, Mrs. Gibson's tone is different, indicating a rivalry between the two women.\n","------\n","\n","\n","803\n","\"Well! Mrs. Gibson, I suppose I must wish you joy of Miss Cynthia's marriage; I should condole with some mothers as had lost their daughters; but you're not one of that sort, I reckon.\"Now, as Mrs. Gibson was not quite sure to which \"sort\" of mothers the greatest credit was to be attached, she found it a little difficult how to frame her reply.\"Dear Cynthia!\" she said. \"One can't but rejoice in her happiness! And yet--\" she ended her sentence by sighing.\"Ay. She was a young woman as would always have her followers; for, to tell the truth, she was as pretty a creature as ever I saw in my life. And all the more she needed skilful guidance. I'm sure I, for one, am as glad as can be she's done so well by herself. Folks say Mr. Henderson has a handsome private fortune over and above what he makes by the law.\"\"There is no fear but that my Cynthia will have everything this world can give!\" said Mrs. Gibson with dignity.\"Well, well! she was always a bit of a favourite of mine; and as I was saying to my grand-daughter there\" (for she was accompanied by a young lady, who looked keenly to the prospect of some wedding-cake), \"I was never one of those who ran her down and called her a flirt and a jilt.

But I were reckoned a very extravagant sort of a body to go so far, and spend my money, though Harry had left me uncommon well off. But now young folks go off to Paris, and think nothing of the cost: and it's well if wilful waste don't make woeful want before they die.

Wedding-cake and wine were brought in, and it was Molly's duty to serve them out. But those last words of Mrs. Goodenough's tingled in her ears, and she tried to interpret them to her own satisfaction in any way but the obvious one. And that, too, was destined to be confirmed; for directly after Mrs. Goodenough took her leave, Mrs. Gibson desired Molly to carry away the tray to a table close to an open corner window, where the things might be placed in readiness for any future callers; and underneath this open window went the path from the house-door to the road. Molly heard Mrs. Goodenough saying to her grand-daughter,--\"That Mrs. Gibson is a deep 'un. There's Mr. Roger Hamley as like as not to have the Hall estate, and she sends Molly a-visiting--\" and then she passed out of hearing. Molly could have burst out crying, with a full sudden conviction of what Mrs. Goodenough had been alluding to: her sense of the impropriety of Molly's going to visit at the Hall when Roger was at home. To be sure, Mrs. Goodenough was a commonplace, unrefined woman. Mrs. Gibson did not seem to have even noticed the allusion. Mr. Gibson took it all as a matter of course that Molly should go to the Hall as simply now, as she had done before. Roger had spoken of it in so straightforward a manner as showed he had no conception of its being an impropriety,--this visit,--this visit until now so happy a subject of anticipation. Molly felt as if she could never speak to any one of the idea to which Mrs. Goodenough's words had given rise; as if she could never be the first to suggest the notion of impropriety, which presupposed what she blushed to think of. Then she tried to comfort herself by reasoning. If it had been wrong, forward, or indelicate, really improper in the slightest degree, who would have been so ready as her father to put his veto upon it? But reasoning was of no use after Mrs. Goodenough's words had put fancies into Molly's head. The more she bade these fancies begone the more they answered her (as Daniel O'Rourke did the man in the moon, when he bade Dan get off his seat on the sickle, and go into empty space):--\"The more ye ask us the more we won't stir.\" One may smile at a young girl's miseries of this kind; but they are very real and stinging miseries to her. All that Molly could do was to resolve on a single eye to the dear old Squire, and his mental and bodily comforts; to try and heal up any breaches which might have occurred between him and AimÄe; and to ignore Roger as much as possible. Good Roger! Kind Roger! Dear Roger! It would be very hard to avoid him as much as was consistent with common politeness; but it would be right to do it; and when she was with him she must be as natural as possible, or he might observe some difference; but what was natural? How much ought she avoid being with him? Would he even notice if she was more chary of her company, more calculating of her words? Alas! the simplicity of their intercourse was spoilt henceforwards! She made laws for herself; she resolved to devote herself to the Squire and to AimÄe, and to forget Mrs. Goodenough's foolish speeches; but her perfect freedom was gone; and with it half her chance--that is to say, half her chance would have been lost over any strangers who had not known her before; they would probably have thought her stiff and awkward, and apt to say things and then retract them. But she was so different from her usual self that Roger noticed the change in her as soon as she arrived at the Hall. She had carefully measured out the days of her visit; they were to be exactly the same number as she had spent at the Towers. She feared lest if she stayed at the Hall a shorter time the Squire might be annoyed. Yet how charming the place looked in its early autumnal glow as she drove up! And there was Roger at the hall-door, waiting to receive her, watching for her coming. And now he retreated, apparently to summon his sister-in-law, who came now timidly forwards in her deep widow's mourning, holding her boy in her arms as if to protect her shyness; but he struggled down, and ran towards the carriage, eager to greet his friend the coachman, and to obtain a promised ride. Roger did not say much himself; he wanted to make AimÄe feel her place as daughter of the house; but she was too timid to speak much. And she only took Molly by the hand and led her into the drawing-room, where, as if by a sudden impulse of gratitude for all the tender nursing she had received during her illness, she put her arms round Molly and kissed her long and well. And after that they came to be friends.\n","------\n","Molly Gibson is serving wedding cake and wine at Hamley Hall when she overhears Mrs. Goodenough talking about the impropriety of Molly visiting the Hall while Roger Hamley is there.

However, when Molly arrives at the Hall, Roger notices her change in\n","------\n","\n","\n","806\n","\"Well! and so you can come here a-visiting though you have been among the grand folks. I thought you were going to cut us, Miss Molly, when I heard you was gone to the Towers. Couldn't find any other place to stay at while father and mother were away, but an earl's, eh?\"\"They asked me, and I went,\" said Molly; \"now you've asked me, and I've come here.\"\"I think you might ha' known you'd be always welcome here, without waiting for asking. Why, Molly! I look upon you as a kind of a daughter more than Madam there!\" dropping his voice a little, and perhaps supposing that the child's babble would drown the signification of his words.--\"Nay, you needn't look at me so pitifully, she doesn't follow English readily.\"\"I think she does!\" said Molly, in a low voice,--not looking up, however, for fear of catching another glimpse at AimÄe's sudden forlornness of expression and deepened colour. She felt grateful, as if for a personal favour, when she heard Roger speaking to AimÄe the moment afterwards in the tender tones of brotherly friendliness; and presently these two were sufficiently engaged in a separate conversation to allow Molly and the Squire to go on talking.\n","------\n","Molly, who has been visiting the grand folks at the Towers, is now visiting the Squire. The Squire is surprised that Molly came to visit him after staying with the earl. He expresses his disappointment that Molly didn't think she would be welcome without being asked. Molly explains that she went to the Towers because she was asked, and she came to visit the Squire because he asked her. The Squire then tells Molly that he considers her to be like a daughter to him,\n","------\n","\n","\n","807\n","\"I s'ant puff any more puffs,\" said the boy, resolutely. \"Mamma says 'No.' I s'ant.\"\"That's just like her!\" said the Squire, dropping his voice this time however. \"As if it could do the child any harm!\"Molly made a point of turning the conversation from all personal subjects after this, and kept the Squire talking about the progress of his drainage during the rest of lunch. He offered to take her to see it; and she acceded to the proposal, thinking, meantime, how little she need have anticipated the being thrown too intimately with Roger, who seemed to devote himself to his sister-in-law. But, in the evening, when AimÄe had gone upstairs to put her boy to bed, and the Squire was asleep in his easy-chair, a sudden flush of memory brought Mrs. Goodenough's words again to her mind. She was virtually tÉte-ł-tÉte with Roger, as she had been dozens of times before, but now she could not help assuming an air of constraint; her eyes did not meet his in the old frank way; she took up a book at a pause in the conversation, and left him puzzled and annoyed at the change in her manner. And so it went on during all the time of her visit. If sometimes she forgot, and let herself go into all her old naturalness, by-and-by she checked herself, and became comparatively cold and reserved. Roger was pained at all this--more pained day after day; more anxious to discover the cause. AimÄe, too, silently noticed how different Molly became in Roger's presence. One day she could not help saying to Molly,--\n","------\n","The boy refuses to have any more puffs because his mother said no. The Squire disagrees with the mother's decision, thinking it wouldn't harm the child. Molly changes the conversation to avoid personal topics and talks about drainage with the Squire. They plan to visit the drainage later. In the evening, when the Squire is asleep and AimÄe is putting her child to bed, Molly remembers Mrs. Goodenough's words and becomes distant and reserved with Roger. This behavior continues throughout\n","------\n","\n","\n","808\n","\"He is very good,\" said Molly. \"I have known him long enough to know that.\"\"But you don't think him agreeable? He is not like my poor husband, to be sure; and you knew him well, too. Ah! tell me about him once again. When you first knew him? When his mother was alive?\"Molly had grown very fond of AimÄe; when the latter was at her ease she had very charming and attaching ways; but feeling uneasy in her position in the Squire's house, she was almost repellent to him; and he, too, put on his worst side to her. Roger was most anxious to bring them together, and had several consultations with Molly as to the best means of accomplishing this end. As long as they talked upon this subject, she spoke to him in the quiet sensible manner which she inherited from her father; but when their discussions on this point were ended, she fell back into her piquant assumption of dignified reserve. It was very difficult for her to maintain this strange manner, especially when once or twice she fancied that it gave him pain; and she would go into her own room and suddenly burst into tears on these occasions, and wish that her visit was ended, and that she was once again in the eventless tranquillity of her own home. Yet presently her fancy changed, and she clung to the swiftly passing hours, as if she would still retain the happiness of each. For, unknown to her, Roger was exerting himself to make her visit pleasant. He was not willing to appear as the instigator of all the little plans for each day, for he felt as if, somehow, he did not hold the same place in her regard as formerly. Still, one day AimÄe suggested a nutting expedition--another day they gave little Roger the unheard-of pleasure of tea out-of-doors--there was something else agreeable for a third; and it was Roger who arranged all these simple pleasures--such as he knew Molly would enjoy. But to her he only appeared as the ready forwarder of AimÄe's devices. The week was nearly gone, when one morning the Squire found Roger sitting in the old library--with a book before him, it is true, but so deep in thought that he was evidently startled by his father's unexpected entrance.\n","------\n","Molly and Roger are discussing a man whom Molly finds good but not agreeable. Molly is fond of AimÄe but feels uneasy in her position in the Squire's house. Roger wants to bring Molly and AimÄe together and seeks advice from Molly on how to do so.

The Squire finds Roger deep in thought in the old library\n","------\n","\n","\n","809\n","So Roger went out with his father, without saying many words till they were at some distance from the house. Then he brought out a sentence with such abruptness that he repaid his father for the start the latter had given him a quarter of an hour before.\"Father, you remember I'm going out again to the Cape next month! You spoke of doing up the library. If it is for me, I shall be away all the winter.\"\"Can't you get off it?\" pleaded his father. \"I thought maybe you'd forgotten all about it.\"\"Not likely!\" said Roger, half smiling.\"Well, but they might have found another man to finish up your work.\"\"No one can finish it but myself. Besides, an engagement is an engagement. When I wrote to Lord Hollingford to tell him I must come home, I promised to go out again for another six months.\"\"Ay. I know. And perhaps it will put it out of thy mind. It will always be hard on me to part from thee. But I daresay it's best for you.\"Roger's colour deepened. \"You are alluding to--to Miss Kirkpatrick--Mrs. Henderson, I mean. Father, let me tell you once for all, I think that was rather a hasty affair. I'm pretty sure now that we were not suited to each other.

I asked your Miss Cynthia out here--and her mother and all--my bark is worse than my bite.

I wonder you are not more taken with her humility and sweetness, father!\"\"I don't even call her pretty,\" said the Squire uneasily, for he dreaded a repetition of the arguments which Roger had often used to make him give AimÄe her proper due of affection and position. \"Now your Miss Cynthia was pretty, I will say that for her, the baggage! And to think that when you two lads flew right in your father's face, and picked out girls below you in rank and family, you should neither of you have set your fancies on my little Molly there.

Isn't this the five-acre field?\" And soon he was discussing the relative values of meadow, arable and pasture land with his father, as heartily as if he had never known Molly, or loved Cynthia. But the squire was not in such good spirits, and went but heavily into the discussion. At the end of it he said łpropos de bottes,--\"But don't you think you could like her if you tried, Roger?\"Roger knew perfectly well to what his father was alluding, but for an instant he was on the point of pretending to misunderstand. At length, however, he said, in a low voice,--\"I shall never try, father. Don't let us talk any more about it. As I said before, it's too late.\"The Squire was like a child to whom some toy has been refused; from time to time the thought of his disappointment in this matter recurred to his mind; and then he took to blaming Cynthia as the primary cause of Roger's present indifference to womankind.\n","------\n","The plot of this paragraph revolves around a conversation between Roger and his father about the possibility of Roger marrying Molly Gibson. Roger is resistant to the idea and insists that it is too late for him to consider marriage. The squire, Roger's father, is disappointed by Roger's indifference and blames Cynthia for it.\n","------\n","\n","\n","812\n","\"I wish I might never hear of her again--I do. She's been the bane of my Roger, that's what she has. I haven't slept half the night, and it's all her fault. Why, there's my boy saying now that he has no heart for ever marrying, poor lad! I wish it had been you, Molly, my lads had taken a fancy for. I told Roger so t'other day, and I said that for all you were beneath what I ever thought to see them marry,--well--it's of no use--it's too late, now, as he said. Only never let me hear that baggage's name again, that's all, and no offence to you either, lassie. I know you love the wench; but if you'll take an old man's word, you're worth a score of her. I wish young men would think so too,\" he muttered as he went to the side-table to carve the ham, while Molly poured out the tea--her heart very hot all the time, and effectually silenced for a space. It was with the greatest difficulty that she could keep tears of mortification from falling. She felt altogether in a wrong position in that house, which had been like a home to her until this last visit. What with Mrs. Goodenough's remarks, and now this speech of the Squire's, implying--at least to her susceptible imagination--that his father had proposed her as a wife to Roger, and that she had been rejected--she was more glad than she could express, or even think, that she was going home this very morning. Roger came in from his walk while she was in this state of feeling. He saw in an instant that something had distressed Molly; and he longed to have the old friendly right of asking her what it was. But she had effectually kept him at too great a distance during the last few days for him to feel at liberty to speak to her in the old straightforward brotherly way; especially now, when he perceived her efforts to conceal her feelings, and the way in which she drank her tea in feverish haste, and accepted bread only to crumble it about her plate, untouched. It was all that he could do to make talk under these circumstances; but he backed up her efforts as well as he could until AimÄe came down, grave and anxious: her boy had not had a good night, and did not seem well; he had fallen into a feverish sleep now, or she could not have left him. Immediately the whole table was in a ferment. The Squire pushed away his plate, and could eat no more; Roger was trying to extract a detail or a fact out of AimÄe, who began to give way to tears. Molly quickly proposed that the carriage, which had been ordered to take her home at eleven, should come round immediately--she had everything ready packed up, she said,--and bring back her father at once. By leaving directly, she said, it was probable they might catch him after he had returned from his morning visits in the town, and before he had set off on his more distant round. Her proposal was agreed to, and she went upstairs to put on her things. She came down all ready into the drawing-room, expecting to find AimÄe and the Squire there; but during her absence word had been brought to the anxious mother and grandfather that the child had wakened up in a panic, and both had rushed up to their darling. But Roger was in the drawing-room awaiting Molly, with a large bunch of the choicest flowers.\n","------\n","In this paragraph, Molly is upset because someone named \"her\" has caused trouble for her friend Roger.

Roger follows them, questioning whether it is too late\n","------\n","\n","\n","815\n","LX.ROGER HAMLEY'S CONFESSION.Roger had a great deal to think of as he turned away from looking after the carriage as long as it could be seen. The day before, he had believed that Molly had come to view all the symptoms of his growing love for her,--symptoms which he thought had been so patent,--as disgusting inconstancy to the inconstant Cynthia; that she had felt that an attachment which could be so soon transferred to another was not worth having; and that she had desired to mark all this by her changed treatment of him, and so to nip it in the bud. But this morning her old sweet, frank manner had returned--in their last interview, at any rate. He puzzled himself hard to find out what could have distressed her at breakfast-time. He even went so far as to ask Robinson whether Miss Gibson had received any letters that morning; and when he heard that she had had one, he tried to believe that the letter was in some way the cause of her sorrow. So far so good. They were friends again after their unspoken difference; but that was not enough for Roger. He felt every day more and more certain that she, and she alone, could make him happy. He had felt this, and had partly given up all hope, while his father had been urging upon him the very course he most desired to take. No need for \"trying\" to love her, he said to himself,--that was already done. And yet he was very jealous on her behalf. Was that love worthy of her which had once been given to Cynthia? Was not this affair too much a mocking mimicry of the last--again just on the point of leaving England for a considerable time--if he followed her now to her own home,--in the very drawing-room where he had once offered to Cynthia? And then by a strong resolve he determined on this course. They were friends now, and he kissed the rose that was her pledge of friendship. If he went to Africa, he ran some deadly chances; he knew better what they were now than he had done when he went before. Until his return he would not even attempt to win more of her love than he already had. But once safe home again, no weak fancies as to what might or might not be her answer should prevent his running all chances to gain the woman who was to him the one who excelled all. His was not the poor vanity that thinks more of the possible mortification of a refusal than of the precious jewel of a bride that may be won. Somehow or another, please God to send him back safe, he would put his fate to the touch. And till then he would be patient. He was no longer a boy to rush at the coveted object; he was a man capable of judging and abiding.\n","------\n","Roger Hamley has been struggling with his feelings for Molly Gibson. He believed that Molly saw his growing love for her as inconstancy to his previous love interest, Cynthia. However, Molly's behavior towards him has changed, and they have reconciled. Roger is certain that Molly is the one who can make him happy, but he is also jealous on her behalf, wondering if his previous attachment to Cynthia diminishes his love for Molly. Despite his doubts, Roger resolves to pursue Molly and win her\n","------\n","\n","\n","816\n","\"Considering all the trouble I had with her trousseau, I think she might have written to me.\"\"But she did--her first letter was to you, mamma,\" said Molly, her real thoughts still intent upon the Hall--upon the sick child--upon Roger, and his begging for the flower.\"Yes, just a first letter, three pages long, with an account of her crossing; while to you she can write about fashions, and how the bonnets are worn in Paris, and all sorts of interesting things.

Oh! if she had but made more of the uncared-for days that she had passed with him at the Hall! Worse than uncared for; days on which she had avoided him; refused to converse freely with him; given him pain by her change of manner; for she had read in his eyes, heard in his voice, that he had been perplexed and pained, and now her imagination dwelt on and exaggerated the expression of his tones and looks.\n","------\n","Molly's father is concerned about the risks involved in his duty, but believes unnecessary risks should be avoided.

Molly tried hard to forget it in working away at a cushion she was preparing as a present to Cynthia; people did worsted-work in those days. One, two, three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven; all wrong: she was thinking of something else, and had to unpick it. It was a rainy day, too; and Mrs. Gibson, who had planned to go out and pay some calls, had to stay indoors. This made her restless and fidgety. She kept going backwards and forwards to different windows in the drawing-room to look at the weather, as if she imagined that while it rained at one window, it might be fine weather at another.\"Molly--come here! who is that man wrapped up in a cloak,--there,--near the Park wall, under the beech-tree--he has been there this half-hour and more, never stirring, and looking at this house all the time! I think it's very suspicious.\"Molly looked, and in an instant recognized Roger under all his wraps. Her first instinct was to draw back. The next to come forwards, and say--\"Why, mamma, it's Roger Hamley! Look now--he's kissing his hand; he's wishing us good-by in the only way he can!\" And she responded to his sign; but she was not sure if he perceived her modest quiet movement, for Mrs. Gibson became immediately so demonstrative that Molly fancied that her eager foolish pantomimic motions must absorb all his attention.\n","------\n","On the day of Roger's departure, Molly tries to distract herself by working on a cushion for Cynthia. However, she keeps making mistakes and has to unpick her work. It is a rainy day, so Mrs. Gibson is unable to go out and becomes restless. She notices a man wrapped in a cloak outside the house and finds it suspicious. Molly realizes it is Roger and tries to get her mother's attention. She eventually responds to Roger's goodbye gesture, but is unsure if he noticed.\n","------\n","\n","\n","829\n","When she came to a sense of the present, Mrs. Gibson was saying,--\"Upon my word, though Roger Hamley has never been a great favourite of mine, this little attention of his has reminded me very forcibly of a very charming young man--a _soupirant_, as the French would call him--Lieutenant Harper--you must have heard me speak of him, Molly?\"\"I think I have!\" said Molly, absently.\"Well, you remember how devoted he was to me when I was at Mrs. Duncombe's, my first situation, and I only seventeen. And when the recruiting party was ordered to another town, poor Mr. Harper came and stood opposite the schoolroom window for nearly an hour, and I know it was his doing that the band played 'The girl I left behind me,' when they marched out the next day. Poor Mr. Harper! It was before I knew dear Mr. Kirkpatrick! Dear me. How often my poor heart has had to bleed in this life of mine! not but what dear papa is a very worthy man, and makes me very happy. He would spoil me, indeed, if I would let him. Still he is not as rich as Mr. Henderson.\"\n","------\n","Mrs. Gibson reminisces about a charming young man named Lieutenant Harper who was once devoted to her. She recalls a time when he stood outside her schoolroom window for an hour and arranged for a band to play a song for her. She reflects on her past relationships and mentions her current husband, Mr. Kirkpatrick, and her father, who she says is not as wealthy as Mr. Henderson.\n","------\n","\n","\n","830\n","\"It is such a pity!\" said she, \"that I was born when I was. I should so have liked to belong to this generation.\"\"That's sometimes my own feeling,\" said he. \"So many new views seem to be opened in science, that I should like, if it were possible, to live till their reality was ascertained, and one saw what they led to. But I don't suppose that's your reason, my dear, for wishing to be twenty or thirty years younger.\"\"No, indeed. And I did not put it in that hard unpleasant way; I only said I should like to belong to this generation. To tell the truth, I was thinking of Cynthia. Without vanity, I believe I was as pretty as she is--when I was a girl, I mean; I had not her dark eyelashes, but then my nose was straighter. And now look at the difference! I have to live in a little country town with three servants, and no carriage; and she with her inferior good looks will live in Sussex Place, and keep a man and a brougham, and I don't know what. But the fact is, in this generation there are so many more rich young men than there were when I was a girl.\"\n","------\n","The speaker expresses regret about being born in their current generation and wishes they could belong to a younger generation. They mention that there are many new advancements in science that they would like to witness. However, the speaker's true reason for wanting to be younger is because they believe they were as attractive as someone named Cynthia when they were younger. They compare their current life in a small town with limited resources to Cynthia's life of luxury in Sussex Place, attributing the difference to the abundance of wealthy young men\n","------\n","\n","\n","831\n","\"Yes!\" said she. \"I think that was my idea. Of course I should have liked him to be you. I always think if you had gone to the bar you might have succeeded better, and lived in London, too. I don't think Cynthia cares much where she lives, yet you see it has come to her.\"\"What has--London?\"\"Oh, you dear, facetious man. Now that's just the thing to have captivated a jury. I don't believe Walter will ever be so clever as you are. Yet he can take Cynthia to Paris, and abroad, and everywhere. I only hope all this indulgence won't develope the faults in Cynthia's character. It's a week since we heard from her, and I did write so particularly to ask her for the autumn fashions before I bought my new bonnet. But riches are a great snare.\"\"Be thankful you are spared temptation, my dear.\"\"No, I'm not. Everybody likes to be tempted. And, after all, it's very easy to resist temptation, if one wishes.\"\"I don't find it so easy,\" said her husband.\"Here's medicine for you, mamma,\" said Molly, entering with a letter held up in her hand. \"A letter from Cynthia.\"\n","------\n","In this paragraph, a woman named Cynthia is being discussed by two people, one of whom is her mother. The mother expresses regret that Cynthia did not end up with the person she is speaking to, as she believes he would have been more successful and lived in London. However, Cynthia is now with someone else who can take her to Paris and other places. The mother worries that this indulgence may negatively affect Cynthia's character. The conversation then shifts to the mother's desire for Cynthia to send her\n","------\n","\n","\n","832\n","\"Come, come! Remember I belong to the last generation,\" said Mr. Gibson.\"And Cynthia will not notice what I wear,\" said Molly, bright with pleasure at the thought of seeing her again.\"No! but Walter will. He has such a quick eye for dress, and I think I rival papa; if he's a good stepfather, I'm a good stepmother, and I could not bear to see my Molly shabby, and not looking her best. I must have a new gown too. It won't do to look as if we had nothing but the dresses which we wore at the wedding!\"But Molly stood out against the new gown for herself, and urged that if Cynthia and Walter were to come to visit them often, they had better see them as they really were, in dress, habits, and appointments. When Mr. Gibson had left the room, Mrs. Gibson softly reproached Molly for her obstinacy.\"You might have allowed me to beg for a new gown for you, Molly, when you knew how much I had admired that figured silk at Brown's the other day. And now, of course, I can't be so selfish as to get it for myself, and you to have nothing. You should learn to understand the wishes of other people. Still, on the whole, you are a dear, sweet girl, and I only wish--well, I know what I wish; only dear papa does not like it to be talked about. And now cover me up close, and let me go to sleep, and dream about my dear Cynthia and my new shawl!\"\n","------\n","Mr. Gibson and Molly are discussing their upcoming visit from Cynthia and Walter. Molly is excited to see Cynthia again and believes that Cynthia won't notice what Molly is wearing. However, Mr. Gibson points out that Walter has a keen eye for dress and Molly should look her best. Molly disagrees and argues that they should present themselves as they truly are. After Mr. Gibson leaves, Mrs. Gibson reproaches Molly for not allowing her to beg for a new gown for Molly. Mrs. Gibson expresses her\n","------\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(len(summaries))\n","print(len(df))\n","print(summaries[183])\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7bnL2SEJdij3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693169135303,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":148,"user":{"displayName":"Eliza Thornton","userId":"13738708515567558230"}},"outputId":"3d768e68-84d5-49a0-c9bd-f5217adfcaeb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["833\n","833\n","Molly remembers being in the room where her dying mother was and seeing her pale, wan face surrounded by white linen.

However, he is generous and honorable, and his conversations are often insightful despite starting from false premises.The protagonist visits a woman who is believed to be an invalid, but he knows she is actually being harmed. Some people accuse him of humoring her, but he enjoys visiting her and believes it brings her comfort. He also enjoys the company of the woman's conservative husband.
